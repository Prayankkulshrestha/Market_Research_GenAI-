All Rights Reserved\n15 Energy Drink Brands That Aren't Red Bull, Ranked\n\nDrink\n\n15 Energy Drink Brands That Aren't Red Bull, Ranked\nBy Koko Paranteau\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThe energy drink market has exploded into a nearly $23-billion industry in the U.S. alone (via Grand View Research). The array of beverages on the shelves of modern-day grocery and convenience store shelves indicates the sheer size and popularity of energy drinks. These stimulating beverages, which have now stretched into entire cooler cases, show no signs of loosening their grip on American consumers. However, the landscape, cans, and even ingredients have undergone a considerable glow-up since their dawn. Red Bull and its ever-expanding family of flavors remains the industry standard despite encroaching competition from other brands.\nFor years, I've considered myself a closeted energy drink enthusiast, but I recently went public with my love of carbonated, pep-inducing drinks. But finding, let alone ranking and reviewing, a handful of other energy drink brands that could rival Red Bull was a daunting task. I cracked open several different energy-laden beverages and ranked them primarily based on their flavor. Whenever possible, I reached for the brand's original offering, but used lemon-lime (my usual go-to) or anything under the citrus umbrella as a surrogate when possible.\n15. Bucked Up\nKeith Homan/Shutterstock\nBucked Up's hyper-virile-designed can features a possessed-looking stag staring intimidatingly back at you. This brand doesn't offer a flagship flavor, and it seems like its team felt liberated to launch the most vaporous flavor ideas possible, including Blood Raz, Rocket Pop, and Miami.\nOut of morbid curiosity and the awareness that citrus at least grows in Florida, I grabbed a can of Miami and hoped for the best. It was quease-inducing, malty like a cheap beer, and chalky like Smarties \u2014 which meant I had to put Bucked Up down after only a few paltry sips. Where I hoped to locate citrus tones, I met a cacophony of rotting coconut and decaying pineapple, all smothered by artificial sugars and carbonation. Bucked Up's Miami attempts to imitate a pi\u00f1a colada \u2014 but the result tastes more like a dive bar's dump bucket.\n14. Monster\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nI consider Monster, Rockstar, and Red Bull contemporaries and the founding fathers of the energy drink canon. The trio forged the landscape of the cooler aisle I shop today, and if there ever was a Mount Rushmore commemorating the early days of energy drinks, I'd expect to see long cans of their likeness chiseled into a mountainside.\nThat said, the early days of energy drinks were not without their atrocities, crimes, and poorly-aged artifacts. Monster might be the most embarrassing war crime I've encountered in the line of battle. Monster somehow tastes like a burp of itself, not unlike the defunct energy-drink-malt-alcohol hybrid, Sparks.  Its musky, yet indistinct, and masks the flavors of its energy-giving components. Perhaps due to its relative antiquity, Monster, like children's medicine, strains to appeal so much so it reads more like counterfeit sweetness and saline.\nThe drink is coded for kids craving a level-up from Surge or the many flavors of Mtn Dew. But, it's beyond the reach of even the highest dose of taurine. Acrid, unwelcoming, and indistinct beyond its unpleasantness, Monster, like fedoras and dresses-over-jeans, should be a relic of its era.\n13. Ghost\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nThe first time I spotted a Ghost energy drink, I did a double take. It's a bright yellow can, evocative of a color block battery, with a label that depicts a demonic, mouthless ghost mascot. The brand also features startling collabs \u2014 I'm looking at you Sour Patch Kids, Welch's Grape, Swedish Fish, and Warheads. Clearly, Ghost aspires to be the gateway energy drink of Generation Alpha.\nGhost could be included in a starter pack alongside a Nintendo Switch, a pack of Nerds Gummy Clusters, and a subscription to YouTube Kids. Both the Sour Patch Kids blue raspberry and cherry limeade flavors I sampled fell far below the bar that Red Bull set as standard. Both drinks tasted only like generic candy \u2014 which was closer to the mystery flavor of a Dum-Dum lollipop than their respective aim. The Sour Patch Kids flavor missed the candy's signature citric acid zing, while the cherry limeade leaned too heavily into dense cherry. Both beverages left me yearning for yet anotherbeverage just to wash away Ghost's hauntings.\n12. BeGOAT\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nBeGOAT, one of the energy drinks you'll have to hunt for in an upscale or organic grocery store, considers itself a \"clean\" alternative to other energy drink brands. One 12-ounce can contains 200 milligrams of caffeine derived from cascara. Besides this, it also contains  antioxidants, polyphenols, and a healthy dose of stevia for sweetness.\nUnfortunately, the stevia, the not-so-secret ingredient keeping BeGOAT's drinks under 40 calories, has an unpleasant flavor that distracts from the rest of the beverage. I had to search for the floral flavors in the hibiscus lime beverage that I sampled. While this process distracted from the stevia's sting, it made this energy drink brand one that I would not want to try again \u2014 especially when the caffeine content is lower than other brands that I sampled.\n11. C4\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nC4, one of a handful of energy drink brands aimed at gym rats, launched in 2011. It now also offers beverage powders, fat burners, and even testosterone boosters which, along with its intense brand narrative, has always steered me away from it. Despite its athletic branding, C4 incongruously offers a kaleidoscope of flavors fit more for a middle schooler than an Olympian.\nThe C4 catalog consists largely of collaborations between candy and treat brands, like Jolly Rancher, Skittles, and Popsicle, but its proprietary flavors include thoughtful, unique options like the blood orange yuzu I sampled for this ranking. I was excited for the inclusion of yuzu and eagerly snapped open the can with a heart full of excitement. But, I barely found any tart notes present. C4's reading of yuzu, a lemon-adjacent citrus, overplays its sweetness. Instead of being biting and sour, the drink tasted slightly tropical and foul. If I was blindfolded, I would have never guessed that this blood orange yuzu flavor was supposed to be paired with the citrus. I suspect only the sweaty runoff from a customer's lips could gift the drink balance.\n10. Reign Total Body Fuel\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nAfter deep-probing the energy drink aisles, the cans start to blend and suggest a silent, but all-caps, game of one-upmanship between seemingly interchangeable products. An enormous subsect of this new era of energy drinks attempts to convey both toughness and fun and seems to reach two distinct customer bases: youths cramming for a test and middle-aged desk workers who yearn for the carefree, candy-addled days of their childhood.\nReign is no different. Like C4, it conjoins jock imagery with mind-boggling flavor offerings, such as sour gummy worm, white gummy bear, rainbow sherbet, and red dragon. I snatched a rainbow sherbet can hoping the sherbet notes would provide a fruity lift. It was too sweet, but undeniably tasty \u2014 and it made me want to cut it with a generous pour of Topo Chico to dilute its potency. Although this beverage was overwhelmingly sugar-ladened, I was surprised and impressed that it could dial in a flavor as complicated as sherbet. However, the drink made me hyper, which led straight to fatigue. By the time I finished sipping it, I was in need of a nap.\n9. Celsius\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nCelsius offers a generic can, too many flavors to recount, and a low-calorie catalog. In the 20 years since it's been released, it's been celebrated as a wellness-coated product aimed at a more feminine audience \u2014 which is an approach that not many other beverages in its cohort have chosen. Its can even boasts health claims \u2014 which include accelerating the metabolism and burning the body fat of its consumers. Celsius, despite its nondescript can, holds its own amongst the drinks with more braggadocio.\nThough Celsius' flavors tend to blur together, I think of green apple cherry as the valedictorian of its class. It distinct tart green apple notes tickled my taste buds, while it also offered a smacking, Granny Smith apple-flavor that I would return to. Though, Celsius' agreeability lives and dies on cracking and finishing the beverage ice cold; it needs to be served right out of the refrigerator so the liquid glides swiftly down the center of the tongue while keeping the off-putting smack of artificial sugars at bay.\n8. Rockstar\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nRockstar is the brand I've historically blamed for giving energy drinks a bad rap. For no substantiated reason, I've mean-mugged Rockstar's dated aesthetic as a turn-off to an afternoon energy bump.\nThe odor of Rockstar's original beverage hit me before I could taste it; it had a thick aroma of tropical fruit and bubblegum, both of which remained once the liquid hit my tongue. Admittedly, I'd prefer a tropical-inspired beverage with sharp, acidic tones like passion fruit and pineapple. Instead, Rockstar veers into over-ripe guava and lychee. However, Rockstar's portrayal of sweetness, though intense, is pleasant, and the drink itself offers a noticeable personality.\nAlthough it's not as putrid as I thought it would be, I hold firm that Rockstar is similar to black nail polish. It's an alternative product that I, although I don't partake in it, can admire and appreciate. After all, every culture deserves its own energy drink.\n7. Nos\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nWhat do Eva Mendes, Devon Aoki, Kurt Russell, and Nos all have in common? They're all scraps from the \"Fast and the Furious\" franchise. Perhaps Nos was Brian O'Conner's beverage of choice, but I suspect the growing prestige circling the film franchise led to its signature drink taking the back seat. Nos shares a lot in common with the series' early films \u2014 dated looks, lingo, and novelties included.\nNos is not for the faint of heart, but its exactly what it promises: a beverage with a flavor that crashes on the tongue with sharp passion fruit, pineapple, and mango undertones. If Nos was more subdued, it could probably be associated with things other than the thrill-seeking cast of the \"Fast and Furious\" films. It's a tad too aggressive for an everyday sipper, but I'd still crack a can of Nos when I'm looking for a cheap thrill.\n6. Bang\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nJust like every other lifestyle consumer good, it's hard not to judge a book by its cover \u2014 or in Bang's case, by its bull's-eye themed can. With a name like Bang, baggage follows, and the target-evoking illustration on the chunky 16-ounce can's center further led me to assume the worst about Bang.\nBang, like the many second-generation energy drinks, exists without a signature flavor. Though, the entirety of Bang's roster contains zero calories, while its flavors are more evocative of a Kesha-themed nightclub than any armory I've seen. I cracked open cans of Blue Razz and Delish Strawberry Kiss because they were some of the only flavors I could wrap my head around (unlike Rainbow Unicorn or Star Blast). I was pleasantly satiated by the airy, perfectly carbonated, and nostalgic fizz. Both flavors portrayed their assigned profiles with gusto \u2014 they were candy-like but not crushingly so. They both called to mind Laffy Taffy flavors without the icky-sticky notes. Although they're in no way everyday energy drinks, the two flavors don't disappoint. But, they still feel like beverages that should be shared with two straws, milkshake-style, as opposed to crushed solo.\n5. Prime\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nI'm disgraced to admit, for the sake of journalism, that I like Prime \u2014 an energy drink founded by Logan Paul. Like a Hinge date I pretended to go on as a goof, I fell for the bro-ey appeal of the block-letter-adorned can almost immediately.\nThe original flavor is somewhat nondescript, it's solely sweet without any distinguishing attributes. I did pick up on a distracting note near the end of a sip that oddly (but not unpleasantly) reminded me of lemon pepper. I was intrigued enough to taste Prime's other fruit offerings, like lemon-lime and strawberry watermelon. I can confidently say that Prime shines brightest in its citrus category. Though, I felt a tinge of shame every time I raised the can's mouth to my own. I felt like a middle-aged but once-relevant celebrity that was attempting to keep up with a younger generation \u2014 and felt more irrelevant than ever when I imbibed in the potion of the iPad baby generation.\n4. Ardor\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nArdor attempted to replace the 16-ounce hole that the discontinuation of HiBall energy left in drinkers' hearts. Ardor picks up the defunct drink's baton and makes a valiant attempt to claim the throne HiBall occupied for over 15 years. The brand smartly shies away from bombastic flavors so many energy drink brands have relied on. Instead, it favors a delicate touch, reminiscent of the essences of La Croix's sparkling waters.\nWith offerings such as Mexican lime, cucumber mint, and vanilla blackberry, Ardor courts a demure energy drink enthusiast bent on staying above the fray. The secret ingredient of sea salt sets Ardor pushes Ardor above the pack by creating an airy, light, even, and slightly-savory edge that resonates as quaffable and mellows any of the energizing ingredients. The Mexican lime flavor I sampled lacks any notes that point to a specific species of lime, but the beverage does succeed in offering a pithy, zesty note instead of an artificial tartness.\n3. Guru\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nGuru, an energy drink first released in 1999, has come full circle. The brand, with its fire engine-red can and sans serif font, promised nothing but \"plant-based energy,\" which was surely an attempt to sway customers away from wing-bestowing Red Bull to something more natural. Now, Guru fits just like a pair of vintage jeans I'm thrilled to see come back in style.\nAfter trying so many cacophonous, syrupy liquids, Guru was truly a palate cleanser. It contains a modest, but not eyebrow-raising 115 calories per 12-ounce can. Guru's original flavor settles into Coca-Cola-like botanical notes \u2014 rather than an imitation of fruit or candy. On flavor alone, I wouldn't immediately clock Guru as an energy drink. Its flavor is more akin to a cola soda \u2014 which means you could even pair Guru with a meal. Its relative flatness never dissuaded me from taking another gulp. In short, Guru is a can I'd proudly hold in public, though it could use an extra jolt of carbonation.\n2. Bawls\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nBawls Energy is harder to come by now than it was a decade ago. It fell to the wayside as the new class of energy drinks ushered their way into the once-sparse market that Bawls used to occupy.\nIt was the only energy drink I sampled that was sold in a glass bottle. Bawls is immediately recognizable by its lapis-toned 10-ounce bottle adorned with symmetrical, cyst-like bumps surrounding its entire surface. From looks alone, I'd assume Bawls was a Zima-adjacent beverage. The late-joining flavors resembled the lightly boozy, malt beverage from a simpler time. Folks who enjoy drinking the Japanese lemon soda Ramune, or those who still yearn for the defunct Sprite Remix, will appreciate this beverage. Bawls offers an exotic, hazily tropical, citrus note with a crisp finish void of the syrupy smack of most energy drinks I see Gen-Z clutching today.\n1. Riot\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nThough they say it's lonely at the top, I doubt that the adage holds when every single one of the flavors within your family of beverages hits (as the kids say). Sure, I enjoy a couple of Riot's cans more than the others (like citrus lime and strawberry lemonade), but I wouldn't kick any of Riot's 16-ounce vessels off the workstation or out of my cupholder.\nRiot is a near-flawless compromise between the energy drinks of yore and the flashy, health-focused beverages of the current epoch. The brand smartly avoids announcing itself as an accouterment for any specific archetype. This is one of the only truly refreshing drinks on the market; it offers easily-readable, punchy, and acidic notes in each can.I love the citrus lime flavor, as it has a biting edge that's rarely found in other energy drinks on the market.\nMethodology\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nI traversed the landscape of energy drinks to select products for this list. The products I selected could be found at convenience stores, conventional grocers, and boutique markets (such as Erehwon). After I purchased each product, I ranked them based on taste alone, but also consider each brand's history, intended audience, and available flavors.\nTo narrow down which energy drinks would be included on this list, I focused solely on products that relied on stimulants for caffeine, as well as those with naturally-occuring, but chemically isolated, ingredients like taurine, guarana, L-carnitine, B vitamins, and L-theanine. Therefore, tea-dominant drinks fueled by yerba mate, matcha, or green tea were omitted. The result was a list of energy drinks with varying caffeine contents, all comparable to Red Bull."

If you use these links to buy something, we may earn a commission.\nPep is a very precious commodity, especially in fast-paced modern America. If you\u2019re thirsty for a quick pick-me-up, you can get a lift from healthy drinks like green tea or black coffee. If you want something even stronger, you can reach for one of the many colorful, canned energy drinks now crowding your grocer\u2019s cooler, from the ubiquitous Red Bull, which comes loaded with energy-boosting caffeine, taurine, and sugar, to newer better-for-you brands, like the low-calorie, vitamin-packed Celsius.\nDemand for energy drinks has soared in recent years. According to Statista, nearly one-third of Americans aged 18 to 49 consume the highly caffeinated carbonated beverages, with U.S. sales climbing from about $11 billion in 2017 to around $18.5 billion in 2023.\nAny number of these vibrantly labeled concoctions can provide you with ample stimulation to power through your day, but are any of them actually enjoyable to drink?\nI recently sampled seven of America\u2019s top-selling energy drink brands to find the best option based purely on taste. For this survey, I chose one of the most popular flavors from each brand for comparison. The results, much like the effects of these drinks, were eye-opening.\nHere\u2019s how each brand ranked in descending order from my least favorite to the overall best.\nPrime Tropical Punch\nNutrition: (Per 12-oz. Can)\nCalories: 10\nFat: 0 g\nSodium: 55 mg\nCarbs: 3 g (Fiber: 0 g, Sugar: 0 g)\nProtein: 0 g\nOne of the newer brands on store shelves, Prime has quickly become a household name, thanks to its influencer-founders Logan Paul and Olajide \u201cKSI\u201d Olatunji, who\u2019ve capitalized on their social media status to create a booming beverage juggernaut. Though it started out as a line of hydrating sports drinks, the brand expanded into energy drinks in 2023.\nPrime offers eight different energizing flavors, including the popular Tropical Punch, which packs 200 milligrams of caffeine and 300 milligrams of electrolytes into each slender 12-ounce can. I grabbed one from my local grocer for\nThe look: Surprisingly somber. Given the cherry red packaging, I was expecting something more flushed like the classic Hawaiian Punch, but this drink came out cloudy like coconut water. Turns out, that\u2019s because it\u2019s actually made with coconut water concentrate (the second listed ingredient after carbonated water).\nThe taste: Shockingly tannic. The first sip hit with a strong, astringent kick that tingled on the tongue. Once the sensation faded, a swirling melange of tangy, tart, and sweet flavors took over. Like many newer energy drinks, Prime is flavored with the artificial sweetener sucralose, which substantially lowers the calorie count but also gives the drink a synthetic quality that is more noticeable in some drinks than others. Prime tasted the most unnatural to me, which is why I ranked it dead last.\n13 Healthiest Energy Drinks, According to a Dietitian\nGhost Sour Patch Kids Redberry\nNutrition: (Per 16-oz. Can)\nCalories: 5\nFat: 0 g\nSodium: 35 mg\nCarbs: 1 g (Fiber: 0 g, Sugar: 0 g)\nProtein: 0 g\nIf you\u2019ve got a sweet tooth, Ghost is probably the energy drink brand for you. Backed by beverage giant Anheuser-Busch, the label produces a wide range of flavors in partnership with numerous well-known candies including Warheads and Swedish Fish. Its Sour Patch Kids Redberry flavor is perhaps the most popular.\nEach 16-ounce can contains a full 200 milligrams of caffeine and a whopping 1,000 milligrams of taurine, along with moderate doses of ginseng and a range of B vitamins. I grabbed one from a local grocer for $3.49.\nThe look: Golden and effervescent like a sparkling white wine. You could call it \u201cthe Champagne of energy drinks,\u201d if you wanted to sound fancy, but it\u2019s probably more akin to the bargain-brand bubbly that you find at your local pharmacy.\nThe taste: Tart and syrupy. The first sip was all sour lime before a strong sweetness took over. The lingering flavor reminded me of an old-school cherry-flavored freezer pop\u2014specifically, the sugary dregs that collect at the bottom of the plastic pouch after the rest of the popsicle is gone. Like Prime, Ghost is a sugarless product made with sucralose and suffers from the same sort of phoniness. It\u2019s also the most cloyingly sweet of all the drinks in this survey.\nRed Bull\nNutrition: (Per 8.4-oz. Can)\nCalories: 110\nFat: 0 g\nSodium: 105 mg\nCarbs: 29 g (Fiber: 0 g, Sugar: 27 g)\nProtein: 0 g\nThough nowadays you can find entire store refrigerator cases full of different energy drinks, it all started with just one. Red Bull effectively invented the category. The Austrian product first launched in the United States back in 1996 and still stands alone as the top-seller overall, reporting over $7 billion in U.S. sales last year, according to Statista.\nSugar-free and various seasonal flavors are available, but the original formula remains a classic. Made with real sugar, the standard-bearer packs more calories than many other energy drinks, yet delivers one of the lowest doses of caffeine at just 80 milligrams per 8.4-ounce can. I grabbed mine from a local supermarket for $2.\nThe look: Amber-colored like honey with a moderate amount of bubbles, it\u2019s the sort of liquid that looks much the same going in as it does coming out, for better or worse.\nThe taste: Syrupy sweet and vaguely medicinal with a none-too-subtle metallic aftertaste. It\u2019s hard to compare to anything else because Red Bull is its own thing. If you were of legal drinking age back in the early 2000s, you probably mixed it with vodka, a popular combo served at nightspots during that time. Without the added booze, it now tastes very unbalanced. As distinctive as the flavor is, you can find many other options today that deliver the same jolt but without feeling like you just licked a steely light pole.\nIs Red Bull Bad For You? We Asked a Dietitian\nOriginal Green Monster Energy\nNutrition: (Per 16-oz. Can)\nCalories: 230\nFat: 0 g\nSodium: 370 mg\nCarbs: 58 g (Fiber: 0 g, Sugar: 54 g)\nProtein: 0 g\nWith Red Bull\u2019s rising popularity around the turn of the century, imitators were sure to follow. Launched in 2002, Monster Energy amplified what consumers loved about the original energy drink by offering even more caffeine in a bigger 16-ounce can. Now the second-biggest brand after Red Bull, Monster comes in a range of flavors, including White Pineapple and Peaches N\u2019 Cream. Yet, its OG flavor in the black can with green lettering remains a popular choice.\nEach tallboy can contains 160 milligrams of caffeine and a colossal 54 grams of sugar, in addition to hefty doses of B vitamins. I got mine from a local supermarket for $2.50.\nThe look: Slightly foamy and yellow-brown like a light beer. It\u2019s a shade or two darker than its rival Red Bull, which only seems fitting given the one-upsmanship that fueled Monster\u2019s ascent.\nThe taste: Sugary and acidic. The flavor was not entirely dissimilar to Red Bull, but much sweeter and smoother\u2014more like candy and less like cough medicine. I enjoyed this drink much more than I expected\u2014though, to be fair, consuming anything so overloaded with sugar is inevitably bound to boost your mood, if only in the short run.\nC4 Frozen Bombsicle\nNutrition: (Per 1 16-oz. Can)\nCalories: 5\nFat: 0 g\nSodium: 55 mg\nCarbs: 0 g (Sugar: 0 g)\nProtein: 0 g\nMarketed primarily as a sport and fitness product, C4 is one of today\u2019s fastest-growing energy drink brands, offering an array of flavors containing zero sugar, zero carbs, and barely any calories. The Frozen Bombsicle flavor is a standout. In addition to 200 milligrams of caffeine, the drink is infused with beta-alanine, the popular endurance-boosting fitness supplement. I picked up a 16-ounce can at the local supermarket for $3.99.\nThe look: Crystal clear and bubbly like a glass of sparkling water. The clean look seemed in keeping with the brand\u2019s professed clean-living ethos.\nThe taste: Like liquefied Sweet Tarts candies, with hints of raspberry, cherry, and lemon. Though flavorful, the sweetness felt somewhat muted, making for a refreshing, lightly fizzy sip. Like many sugar-free opions, C4 contains sucralose, yet didn\u2019t taste as outright synthetic as other drinks in this survey, which helped to propel this brand into my top three.\n13 Energy Drinks With the Most Sugar\u2014Ranked!\nCelsius Sparkling Orange\nNutrition: (Per 1 16-oz. Can)\nCalories: 10\nFat: 0 g\nSodium: 5 mg\nCarbs: 0 mg\nProtein: 0 g\nAnother fitness-focused, better-for-you brand, fast-growing Celsius started in Sweden and now stands as America\u2019s third top-selling energy drink after Red Bull and Monster. It comes in 27 different flavors, with Sparkling Orange among the most popular\u2014so popular, in fact, I had to visit multiple stores to find it. Fully loaded with B vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine, the 12-ounce can cost me $3.50 at a local bodega.\nThe look: A translucent tangerine color that recalled the classic orange-flavored Gatorade, this fizzy drink beamed with sports drink vibes from the get-go.\nThe taste: Like a drier version of Sunkist orange soda, it\u2019s bright, crisp, and subtly citrusy with only a hint of sweetness. That restraint with the sweetener seemed to limit the artificial effect you normally get from the sucralose. Overall, this refreshing drink offered the most well-balanced sip of all the energy drinks I tried. Yet, there was one brand that I enjoyed even better.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e\nAre Celsius Energy Drinks Healthy? We Asked a Dietitian\nAlani Nu Cherry Slush\nNutrition: (Per 12-oz.

Its Cherry Slush flavor is a top-seller. Like many of its contemporaries, this drink comes loaded with B vitamins and 200 milligrams of caffeine, but it also delivers a feeling you won\u2019t get with other energy drinks. It\u2019s available in both mini-sized 8.4-ounce and full-sized 12-ounce cans. I picked up the bigger version for $2.99 at my local Walgreens.\nThe look: Distinct. This drink poured an eye-popping hot pink color with just the right amount of fizz.\nThe taste: Nostalgic. This flavor lived up to its billing\u2014a dead ringer for the classic cherry-flavored Icee. With the first sip, I was immediately transported back to childhood, slurping my frosty treat through a big red straw while gazing up at the movie screen. It\u2019s fruity and sweet just like the popular frozen carbonated beverage, albeit much easier on the conscience with none of the sugar and only a fraction of the calories. The fizzy drink went down easy, too. Its smooth mouthfeel stood in stark contrast to the abrasive bite of other energy drinks.\nFrom a pure enjoyment perspective, Alani\u2019s Cherry Slush was the only option that left me not just energized but excited to drink it again.\n$13.99/6-pack\n at Amazon\nBuy Now\nSign up for our newsletter!\nWhy Trust Eat This, Not That!?\nEat This, Not That! is committed to creating high-quality content that you can trust to be accurate, properly researched, routinely reviewed, and updated with the latest information.

Gone are the days when energy drinks were just about a caffeine boost. Now, consumers expect more \u2013 more taste, more benefits, and more excitement. Beverage industry trends are reflecting this shift, with brands introducing a wave of bold and refreshing energy drink flavours that are as functional as they are enjoyable. Today\u2019s energy drinks aren\u2019t just about energy \u2013 they\u2019re about the experience. So, what\u2019s trending in the world of flavours? Let\u2019s dive in.\nGamer Culture\u2019s Big Impact on Energy Drink Flavours\nIf there\u2019s one group that\u2019s reshaping the world of energy drink flavours, it\u2019s gamers. The 2025 beverage trends show just how much this community has influenced the market. Gamers \u2013 especially Gen Z \u2013 want more than just a quick fix. They need drinks that can keep them alert, focused, and sharp during long gaming sessions. And the industry has listened.\nIngredients for energy drinks now include brain-boosting compounds like nootropics, alongside vitamins. Adaptogenic beverages and other functional beverages like Arla Food ingredients\u2019 most recent beverage concept have similar claims. This type of beverages targeted towards E-Sport athletes and gamers are formulated to increase cognition, concentration and performance. It\u2019s not just about energy anymore \u2013 it is about giving gamers the mental edge they need along along with other functional ingredients like magnesium, zinc and protein. This shift has led to some interesting collaborations between brands and gaming influencers. These partnerships create flavours that not only taste great but also tap into the gaming culture, with bold, punchy options that resonate with a younger audience.\nThink of flavours that pack a punch, like tropical blends with a tangy twist, or sharp citrus profiles that keep you going. These drinks aren\u2019t just marketed for their energy boost but for how they fit into the gaming lifestyle. As gaming continues to grow, expect even more unique flavours designed specifically for this high-energy, fast-paced world.\nThe Rise of Exotic Fruit Flavours from Asia and Latin America\nThere\u2019s a clear shift in the energy drink world towards more adventurous, exotic flavours. Consumers are increasingly drawn to flavour creation that transports them somewhere new, and exotic fruits from Asia and Latin America are doing just that. Flavours like pawpaw, pitaya, and guavasteen are growing in popularity, offering a unique twist that stands out in the crowded market.\nThese fruits are not only intriguing but also bring a sense of freshness and health-consciousness. In line with trends in the beverage industry, consumers are leaning more towards natural, clean ingredients that offer both taste and functional benefits. Exotic fruits check all the boxes \u2013 refreshing, unique, and perceived as healthier alternatives to overly sweetened options. Brands are catching on, using these fruits to create vibrant, exciting energy drinks that appeal to the adventurous consumer.\nSource: The evolution of four trendy US flavors \u2013 Mintel\nTrending Flavours for Energy Drinks in 2025\nPrickly Pear\nResearch from Mintel show that US consumers are particularly interested in prickly pear in non-alcoholic beverages.\nRead more\nBlue Raspberry\nFruity, sweet, ripe and candy-like. Blue Raspberry has been used as a flavour frequently in sports drinks, energy drinks and hydration drinks.\nPassionfruit\nPassionfruit is a tropical fruit known for its vibrant flavour\u2014both sweet and tangy with a hint of citrus. Its aromatic, jelly-like pulp is bursting with a refreshing taste that adds an exotic twist\nMango\nSweet, ripe and tropical - a permanent classic when it comes to energy Drinks, often infused with added juice.\nWhite Peach\nSweet, fruity and ripe. White Peach were probably one of the most popular flavours in 2025.\nBlood Orange\nSweet, fruity and citrusy. Not only is blood orange a popular choice in energy drinks. It is also seen a lot in sports - and hydration drinks\nPink Dragon Fruit\nPitaya or Pink Dragon Fruit offers a mildly sweet flavour with a hint of earthiness. It\u2019s often described as a mix between kiwi and pear, but with a strikingly vibrant pink colour that makes it a visual showstopper.\nBerry flavours\nBerry Blast, Berry Fusion and other mixed Berry flavours has grown in dominance in sport and energy drink launches.\nRead more\nConcept and fantasy flavours.\nAs traditional fruit flavors become less novel and increasingly finite, energy drink brands are turning to fantasy and concept flavors like unicorn flavours and rainbow flavours to stand out in a competitive market. We are likely to see more fantasy names like \"Ultra Rosa\", \"Starlight\" and \"Unicorn\" in 2025 and beyond.\nRead more\nGreen Tea\nSmooth, rich and earthy.

Ardor picks up the defunct drink's baton and makes a valiant attempt to claim the throne HiBall occupied for over 15 years.

The brand, with its fire engine-red can and sans serif font, promised nothing but \"plant-based energy,\" which was surely an attempt to sway customers away from wing-bestowing Red Bull to something more natural.

All Rights Reserved\n15 Energy Drink Brands That Aren't Red Bull, Ranked\n\nDrink\n\n15 Energy Drink Brands That Aren't Red Bull, Ranked\nBy Koko Paranteau\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThe energy drink market has exploded into a nearly $23-billion industry in the U.S. alone (via Grand View Research). The array of beverages on the shelves of modern-day grocery and convenience store shelves indicates the sheer size and popularity of energy drinks. These stimulating beverages, which have now stretched into entire cooler cases, show no signs of loosening their grip on American consumers. However, the landscape, cans, and even ingredients have undergone a considerable glow-up since their dawn. Red Bull and its ever-expanding family of flavors remains the industry standard despite encroaching competition from other brands.\nFor years, I've considered myself a closeted energy drink enthusiast, but I recently went public with my love of carbonated, pep-inducing drinks. But finding, let alone ranking and reviewing, a handful of other energy drink brands that could rival Red Bull was a daunting task. I cracked open several different energy-laden beverages and ranked them primarily based on their flavor. Whenever possible, I reached for the brand's original offering, but used lemon-lime (my usual go-to) or anything under the citrus umbrella as a surrogate when possible.\n15. Bucked Up\nKeith Homan/Shutterstock\nBucked Up's hyper-virile-designed can features a possessed-looking stag staring intimidatingly back at you. This brand doesn't offer a flagship flavor, and it seems like its team felt liberated to launch the most vaporous flavor ideas possible, including Blood Raz, Rocket Pop, and Miami.\nOut of morbid curiosity and the awareness that citrus at least grows in Florida, I grabbed a can of Miami and hoped for the best. It was quease-inducing, malty like a cheap beer, and chalky like Smarties \u2014 which meant I had to put Bucked Up down after only a few paltry sips. Where I hoped to locate citrus tones, I met a cacophony of rotting coconut and decaying pineapple, all smothered by artificial sugars and carbonation. Bucked Up's Miami attempts to imitate a pi\u00f1a colada \u2014 but the result tastes more like a dive bar's dump bucket.\n14. Monster\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nI consider Monster, Rockstar, and Red Bull contemporaries and the founding fathers of the energy drink canon. The trio forged the landscape of the cooler aisle I shop today, and if there ever was a Mount Rushmore commemorating the early days of energy drinks, I'd expect to see long cans of their likeness chiseled into a mountainside.\nThat said, the early days of energy drinks were not without their atrocities, crimes, and poorly-aged artifacts. Monster might be the most embarrassing war crime I've encountered in the line of battle. Monster somehow tastes like a burp of itself, not unlike the defunct energy-drink-malt-alcohol hybrid, Sparks.  Its musky, yet indistinct, and masks the flavors of its energy-giving components. Perhaps due to its relative antiquity, Monster, like children's medicine, strains to appeal so much so it reads more like counterfeit sweetness and saline.\nThe drink is coded for kids craving a level-up from Surge or the many flavors of Mtn Dew. But, it's beyond the reach of even the highest dose of taurine. Acrid, unwelcoming, and indistinct beyond its unpleasantness, Monster, like fedoras and dresses-over-jeans, should be a relic of its era.\n13. Ghost\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nThe first time I spotted a Ghost energy drink, I did a double take. It's a bright yellow can, evocative of a color block battery, with a label that depicts a demonic, mouthless ghost mascot. The brand also features startling collabs \u2014 I'm looking at you Sour Patch Kids, Welch's Grape, Swedish Fish, and Warheads. Clearly, Ghost aspires to be the gateway energy drink of Generation Alpha.\nGhost could be included in a starter pack alongside a Nintendo Switch, a pack of Nerds Gummy Clusters, and a subscription to YouTube Kids. Both the Sour Patch Kids blue raspberry and cherry limeade flavors I sampled fell far below the bar that Red Bull set as standard. Both drinks tasted only like generic candy \u2014 which was closer to the mystery flavor of a Dum-Dum lollipop than their respective aim. The Sour Patch Kids flavor missed the candy's signature citric acid zing, while the cherry limeade leaned too heavily into dense cherry. Both beverages left me yearning for yet anotherbeverage just to wash away Ghost's hauntings.\n12. BeGOAT\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nBeGOAT, one of the energy drinks you'll have to hunt for in an upscale or organic grocery store, considers itself a \"clean\" alternative to other energy drink brands. One 12-ounce can contains 200 milligrams of caffeine derived from cascara. Besides this, it also contains  antioxidants, polyphenols, and a healthy dose of stevia for sweetness.\nUnfortunately, the stevia, the not-so-secret ingredient keeping BeGOAT's drinks under 40 calories, has an unpleasant flavor that distracts from the rest of the beverage. I had to search for the floral flavors in the hibiscus lime beverage that I sampled. While this process distracted from the stevia's sting, it made this energy drink brand one that I would not want to try again \u2014 especially when the caffeine content is lower than other brands that I sampled.\n11. C4\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nC4, one of a handful of energy drink brands aimed at gym rats, launched in 2011. It now also offers beverage powders, fat burners, and even testosterone boosters which, along with its intense brand narrative, has always steered me away from it. Despite its athletic branding, C4 incongruously offers a kaleidoscope of flavors fit more for a middle schooler than an Olympian.\nThe C4 catalog consists largely of collaborations between candy and treat brands, like Jolly Rancher, Skittles, and Popsicle, but its proprietary flavors include thoughtful, unique options like the blood orange yuzu I sampled for this ranking. I was excited for the inclusion of yuzu and eagerly snapped open the can with a heart full of excitement. But, I barely found any tart notes present. C4's reading of yuzu, a lemon-adjacent citrus, overplays its sweetness. Instead of being biting and sour, the drink tasted slightly tropical and foul. If I was blindfolded, I would have never guessed that this blood orange yuzu flavor was supposed to be paired with the citrus. I suspect only the sweaty runoff from a customer's lips could gift the drink balance.\n10. Reign Total Body Fuel\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nAfter deep-probing the energy drink aisles, the cans start to blend and suggest a silent, but all-caps, game of one-upmanship between seemingly interchangeable products. An enormous subsect of this new era of energy drinks attempts to convey both toughness and fun and seems to reach two distinct customer bases: youths cramming for a test and middle-aged desk workers who yearn for the carefree, candy-addled days of their childhood.\nReign is no different. Like C4, it conjoins jock imagery with mind-boggling flavor offerings, such as sour gummy worm, white gummy bear, rainbow sherbet, and red dragon. I snatched a rainbow sherbet can hoping the sherbet notes would provide a fruity lift. It was too sweet, but undeniably tasty \u2014 and it made me want to cut it with a generous pour of Topo Chico to dilute its potency. Although this beverage was overwhelmingly sugar-ladened, I was surprised and impressed that it could dial in a flavor as complicated as sherbet. However, the drink made me hyper, which led straight to fatigue. By the time I finished sipping it, I was in need of a nap.\n9. Celsius\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nCelsius offers a generic can, too many flavors to recount, and a low-calorie catalog. In the 20 years since it's been released, it's been celebrated as a wellness-coated product aimed at a more feminine audience \u2014 which is an approach that not many other beverages in its cohort have chosen. Its can even boasts health claims \u2014 which include accelerating the metabolism and burning the body fat of its consumers. Celsius, despite its nondescript can, holds its own amongst the drinks with more braggadocio.\nThough Celsius' flavors tend to blur together, I think of green apple cherry as the valedictorian of its class. It distinct tart green apple notes tickled my taste buds, while it also offered a smacking, Granny Smith apple-flavor that I would return to. Though, Celsius' agreeability lives and dies on cracking and finishing the beverage ice cold; it needs to be served right out of the refrigerator so the liquid glides swiftly down the center of the tongue while keeping the off-putting smack of artificial sugars at bay.\n8. Rockstar\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nRockstar is the brand I've historically blamed for giving energy drinks a bad rap. For no substantiated reason, I've mean-mugged Rockstar's dated aesthetic as a turn-off to an afternoon energy bump.\nThe odor of Rockstar's original beverage hit me before I could taste it; it had a thick aroma of tropical fruit and bubblegum, both of which remained once the liquid hit my tongue. Admittedly, I'd prefer a tropical-inspired beverage with sharp, acidic tones like passion fruit and pineapple. Instead, Rockstar veers into over-ripe guava and lychee. However, Rockstar's portrayal of sweetness, though intense, is pleasant, and the drink itself offers a noticeable personality.\nAlthough it's not as putrid as I thought it would be, I hold firm that Rockstar is similar to black nail polish. It's an alternative product that I, although I don't partake in it, can admire and appreciate. After all, every culture deserves its own energy drink.\n7. Nos\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nWhat do Eva Mendes, Devon Aoki, Kurt Russell, and Nos all have in common? They're all scraps from the \"Fast and the Furious\" franchise. Perhaps Nos was Brian O'Conner's beverage of choice, but I suspect the growing prestige circling the film franchise led to its signature drink taking the back seat. Nos shares a lot in common with the series' early films \u2014 dated looks, lingo, and novelties included.\nNos is not for the faint of heart, but its exactly what it promises: a beverage with a flavor that crashes on the tongue with sharp passion fruit, pineapple, and mango undertones. If Nos was more subdued, it could probably be associated with things other than the thrill-seeking cast of the \"Fast and Furious\" films. It's a tad too aggressive for an everyday sipper, but I'd still crack a can of Nos when I'm looking for a cheap thrill.\n6. Bang\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nJust like every other lifestyle consumer good, it's hard not to judge a book by its cover \u2014 or in Bang's case, by its bull's-eye themed can. With a name like Bang, baggage follows, and the target-evoking illustration on the chunky 16-ounce can's center further led me to assume the worst about Bang.\nBang, like the many second-generation energy drinks, exists without a signature flavor. Though, the entirety of Bang's roster contains zero calories, while its flavors are more evocative of a Kesha-themed nightclub than any armory I've seen. I cracked open cans of Blue Razz and Delish Strawberry Kiss because they were some of the only flavors I could wrap my head around (unlike Rainbow Unicorn or Star Blast). I was pleasantly satiated by the airy, perfectly carbonated, and nostalgic fizz. Both flavors portrayed their assigned profiles with gusto \u2014 they were candy-like but not crushingly so. They both called to mind Laffy Taffy flavors without the icky-sticky notes. Although they're in no way everyday energy drinks, the two flavors don't disappoint. But, they still feel like beverages that should be shared with two straws, milkshake-style, as opposed to crushed solo.\n5. Prime\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nI'm disgraced to admit, for the sake of journalism, that I like Prime \u2014 an energy drink founded by Logan Paul. Like a Hinge date I pretended to go on as a goof, I fell for the bro-ey appeal of the block-letter-adorned can almost immediately.\nThe original flavor is somewhat nondescript, it's solely sweet without any distinguishing attributes. I did pick up on a distracting note near the end of a sip that oddly (but not unpleasantly) reminded me of lemon pepper. I was intrigued enough to taste Prime's other fruit offerings, like lemon-lime and strawberry watermelon. I can confidently say that Prime shines brightest in its citrus category. Though, I felt a tinge of shame every time I raised the can's mouth to my own. I felt like a middle-aged but once-relevant celebrity that was attempting to keep up with a younger generation \u2014 and felt more irrelevant than ever when I imbibed in the potion of the iPad baby generation.\n4. Ardor\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nArdor attempted to replace the 16-ounce hole that the discontinuation of HiBall energy left in drinkers' hearts. Ardor picks up the defunct drink's baton and makes a valiant attempt to claim the throne HiBall occupied for over 15 years. The brand smartly shies away from bombastic flavors so many energy drink brands have relied on. Instead, it favors a delicate touch, reminiscent of the essences of La Croix's sparkling waters.\nWith offerings such as Mexican lime, cucumber mint, and vanilla blackberry, Ardor courts a demure energy drink enthusiast bent on staying above the fray. The secret ingredient of sea salt sets Ardor pushes Ardor above the pack by creating an airy, light, even, and slightly-savory edge that resonates as quaffable and mellows any of the energizing ingredients. The Mexican lime flavor I sampled lacks any notes that point to a specific species of lime, but the beverage does succeed in offering a pithy, zesty note instead of an artificial tartness.\n3. Guru\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nGuru, an energy drink first released in 1999, has come full circle. The brand, with its fire engine-red can and sans serif font, promised nothing but \"plant-based energy,\" which was surely an attempt to sway customers away from wing-bestowing Red Bull to something more natural. Now, Guru fits just like a pair of vintage jeans I'm thrilled to see come back in style.\nAfter trying so many cacophonous, syrupy liquids, Guru was truly a palate cleanser. It contains a modest, but not eyebrow-raising 115 calories per 12-ounce can. Guru's original flavor settles into Coca-Cola-like botanical notes \u2014 rather than an imitation of fruit or candy. On flavor alone, I wouldn't immediately clock Guru as an energy drink. Its flavor is more akin to a cola soda \u2014 which means you could even pair Guru with a meal. Its relative flatness never dissuaded me from taking another gulp. In short, Guru is a can I'd proudly hold in public, though it could use an extra jolt of carbonation.\n2. Bawls\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nBawls Energy is harder to come by now than it was a decade ago. It fell to the wayside as the new class of energy drinks ushered their way into the once-sparse market that Bawls used to occupy.\nIt was the only energy drink I sampled that was sold in a glass bottle. Bawls is immediately recognizable by its lapis-toned 10-ounce bottle adorned with symmetrical, cyst-like bumps surrounding its entire surface. From looks alone, I'd assume Bawls was a Zima-adjacent beverage. The late-joining flavors resembled the lightly boozy, malt beverage from a simpler time. Folks who enjoy drinking the Japanese lemon soda Ramune, or those who still yearn for the defunct Sprite Remix, will appreciate this beverage. Bawls offers an exotic, hazily tropical, citrus note with a crisp finish void of the syrupy smack of most energy drinks I see Gen-Z clutching today.\n1. Riot\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nThough they say it's lonely at the top, I doubt that the adage holds when every single one of the flavors within your family of beverages hits (as the kids say). Sure, I enjoy a couple of Riot's cans more than the others (like citrus lime and strawberry lemonade), but I wouldn't kick any of Riot's 16-ounce vessels off the workstation or out of my cupholder.\nRiot is a near-flawless compromise between the energy drinks of yore and the flashy, health-focused beverages of the current epoch. The brand smartly avoids announcing itself as an accouterment for any specific archetype. This is one of the only truly refreshing drinks on the market; it offers easily-readable, punchy, and acidic notes in each can.I love the citrus lime flavor, as it has a biting edge that's rarely found in other energy drinks on the market.\nMethodology\nKoko Paranteau/Tasting Table\nI traversed the landscape of energy drinks to select products for this list. The products I selected could be found at convenience stores, conventional grocers, and boutique markets (such as Erehwon). After I purchased each product, I ranked them based on taste alone, but also consider each brand's history, intended audience, and available flavors.\nTo narrow down which energy drinks would be included on this list, I focused solely on products that relied on stimulants for caffeine, as well as those with naturally-occuring, but chemically isolated, ingredients like taurine, guarana, L-carnitine, B vitamins, and L-theanine. Therefore, tea-dominant drinks fueled by yerba mate, matcha, or green tea were omitted. The result was a list of energy drinks with varying caffeine contents, all comparable to Red Bull."

In fact, energy drinks are powering ahead in convenience retail this year, and 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. After a slower 2024, C-store energy drink sales are back in growth mode, with dollar sales up 7.9% and units up 5.7% in the 52 weeks ending May 18, according to NACS magazine. That translates to more than 1.8 billion units sold in c-stores in just one year. Energy shots, by comparison, have remained flat or slightly down.\nFor context, nonalcoholic packaged beverages made up 18% of total in-store sales last year, making the way you allocate cooler door real estate one of the biggest factors in your store\u2019s success. Here\u2019s an overview of the 2025 energy drink trends you should know about\u2014and the steps you can take to optimize sales.\nElectrifying 2025 Energy Drink Trends\n1) Energy Becomes a Value Choice\nWith overall beverage price inflation, energy drinks have become a relative value. Prices in the category have increased more slowly than other packaged drinks like coffee and tea, which has improved their \u201cprice per kick\u201d proposition. This trend is helping maintain strong unit sales even as customers watch their wallets more closely.\nEnergy drink brands are rolling out more aggressive multi-buy promotions, offering discounts when customers purchase 2, 3, or even 4 cans at once. These tiered deals lower the price per unit, boost basket size, and drive higher overall sales volume.\n2) Zero-Sugar and Flavor Innovation Drive Growth\nThe biggest innovation trend in 2025 is the explosion of zero-sugar and flavor-forward energy drinks. Here are just a few examples:\n\nMonster introduced its zero-sugar Ultra Blue Hawaiian in February. It was a hit with retailers, who cited strong velocity and high demand.\nRed Bull continues with limited-time flavors like the Spring Edition (grapefruit) and Summer Edition White Peach, designed to bring excitement and repeat trips.\nNew product launches such as Celsius Essentials, Red Bull Sea Blue, and Prime Energy all made Circana\u2019s New Product Pacesetters list, showing how innovation keeps fueling consumer interest.\n\nZero-sugar SKUs and seasonal launches are among the top-performing categories in the cold vault.\n3) Consolidation is Changing the Market\nAnother notable 2025 energy drink trend is consolidation among major brands. Celsius announced its $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu, while Keurig Dr Pepper bought into Ghost, and Molson Coors took a majority stake in ZOA. These moves are reshaping promotional strategies and expanding distribution, creating stronger portfolio plays that retailers should prepare to leverage.\n4) Shelf Space is Expanding\u2014But Execution Matters\nRetailers are consistently adding more cooler space for energy drinks during resets. However, increasing facings is only effective if shelves stay stocked. Industry surveys show that empty facings are becoming a bigger problem, canceling out the benefits of added doors. Maintaining inventory at the store level is essential to optimizing sales.\nHow Store Managers Can Capitalize on 2025 Energy Drink Trends\nKeep Core SKUs In-Stock\nStart with your top 16-oz SKUs\u2014Red Bull core, Monster Ultra, Celsius top flavors\u2014and double-face your fastest movers. Make daily cold-vault checks part of shift routines to prevent costly out-of-stocks.\nHighlight Zero-Sugar and Seasonal Editions\nCreate a dedicated zero-sugar row across all brands and a rotating pocket for limited-time flavors. Use signage and shelf talkers to showcase what\u2019s new. Ensure your employees know about new products and can encourage customers to try them, too. Consumers look for novelty, and \u201cLimited-Time\u201d offers provide it.\nTrim the Long Tail\nToo many slow-moving SKUs can weaken your set. Review the bottom 10% of SKUs quarterly with district leadership and seek to reallocate those slots to high-velocity zero-sugar options or tiered promotions. Reducing clutter makes the set easier to shop.\nPromote Tiered Multi-Buy Promotions\nH&S Energy\u2019s multi-buy deals remain one of the most effective promotional tactics store managers can use to grow sales. For example, some C-stores report 16% unit lifts from tiered offers like \u201c2 for $6, 3 for $7, 4 for $8\u201d on Monster singles. These promotions encourage larger baskets and should be timed to hot-weather or peak commuter periods. Ensure your team is fully informed about current tiered multi-buy promotions and that all promotional signage is clearly visible and well-positioned.\nMerchandise by Daypart\nEnergy is no longer just for late-night customers looking for a second wind! Place secondary racks near coffee for morning traffic, and pair with salty snacks for mid-afternoon sales. Convenience shoppers are receptive to impulse energy purchases when displays are visible and convenient.\nKeep Energy Shots Tight\nShots are underperforming compared to cans, but they still serve a purpose. Carry a trimmed assortment of top sellers near the checkout area for impulse purchases and cross-merchandise with hydration products in the summer.\nWhy 2025 Energy Drink Trends Matter\nThe energy category remains one of the strongest growth engines in the convenience channel. These 2025 energy drink trends\u2014value pricing, zero-sugar innovation, consolidation, and expanded shelf space\u2014are setting the stage for higher velocity and more profitable promotions. C-store managers who adapt quickly will be positioned to capture more trips, grow larger baskets, and build stronger loyalty among their customers.\nAt H&S Energy, we do more than supply fuel\u2014we partner with convenience store managers to help their beverage categories thrive.

        "raw_content": "Energy Drinks & Shots\n2025 State of the Beverage Industry: Health consciousness influencing new age energy drink solutions\nConsumers look to energy drink category for functional benefits\nBy Lauren Sabetta, Managing Editor\nJuly 8, 2025\nWhen it comes to the popularity of energy drinks, health and wellness trends continue to be factors driving the success of the category. However, with the blurring of lines in functional beverages, the category is facing some competition, experts note.\nIn Beverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue, Sally Lyons Wyatt, global executive vice president and chief adviser for consumer packaged goods and foodservice at Chicago-based Circana, noted that what\u2019s interesting about energy drinks is that the category has risen above the clouds of blurriness in the functional beverage market.\n\u201cEnergy is definitely coming through with strong unit and dollar sales,\u201d Lyons Wyatt said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen so many different categories, whether it be water, whether it be soft drinks, whether it be dairy products, all trying to get into what would be this functional beverage space.\u201d\nAccording to Circana data, the total energy drink category was just shy of $25 billion in sales, an increase of 5.5%, in U.S. multi-outlets and convenience stores for the 52 weeks ending April 20. Meanwhile, unit sales were up 2.9% for the same time period.\nSydney Riebe, analyst for food and drinks reports at Mintel, Chicago, noted in Beverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue, that strong performance for the energy drink and shots category was driven almost exclusively by energy drinks in the past year.\nReign Storm, a brand of Monster Beverage Corp., unveiled its new Reign Storm Tropical, made with a blend of plant-based ingredients that support immunity, accelerate metabolism, and deliver a sugar-free energy surge, it says.\nImage courtesy of Monster Beverage Corp.\n\u201cEnergy drink growth is on par with other functional drink categories like sports and nutrition drinks,\u201d Riebe explained. \u201cWhile a smaller market, the performance drink category is growing more rapidly, focusing on health as well as energy enhancing claims that indicate a continued blurring of categories due to common consumer interests across beverages.\u201d\nRoger Dilworth, senior analyst at Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC), Wintersville, Ohio, noted that despite energy shots\u2019 decline \u2014 approximately 2-3% in terms of both volume and retail dollar sales \u2014 the overall energy drink category showed strong growth in the past year.\n\u201cEnergy drinks grew volume by about 6% in 2023 and retail dollars by around 13%, much stronger than sports drinks and a little slower than protein drinks,\u201d he said inBeverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue.\nMeeting the moment\nWith continued blurring of the lines and more consumers looking to functional beverages to support well-being, experts weighed in on how the energy drink category can further meet consumers\u2019 various need states.\nCircana\u2019s Lyons Wyatt suggested beverage-makers should look to make products more accessible and available where consumers are for different moments around the day.\n\u201cI would say that there are functional beverages that cater to consumers that are on a well-being journey and it could be for pre-, during or post workout,\u201d she said in Beverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue. \u201cBut energy drinks kind of fit more toward an extra boost through the day\u2026 and that might mean, \u2018I need a boost to get through my fitness routine.\u2019 \u2026 And I think what some companies have done well is made it accessible when and where consumers might be considering a functional beverage.\u201d\nMintel\u2019s Riebe, meanwhile, pointed to consumers\u2019 growing demand for drinks with natural ingredients and health claims such as hydration as driving innovation.\n\u201cConsumer interest in health has driven the energy drink market toward more natural, functional and fitness-oriented products that are marketed as a lifestyle and are attracting traditionally less engaged category consumers like younger women,\u201d she explained in Beverage Industry\u2019sAugust 2024 issue\nFurther, Riebe noted how sugar reduction trends are impacting the energy drinks and shots market.\n\u201cWith around one-third of U.S. adults who have decreased energy drink consumption citing concerns with sugar as the reason, it is not surprising that the North American market has responded with over half of new product launches carrying the sugar-free claim in the past year,\u201d she said. \u201cAn overall rise in the use of natural sweeteners and improvement of their tastes look to make sugar-free options more appealing.\u201d\nMade with no artificial ingredients, zero sugar, B vitamins and l-theanine, Black Rifle Energy is available in four flavors: Freedom Punch, Wild Frost, Ranger Berry and Project Mango.\nImage courtesy of Black Rifle Coffee Co.\nBMC\u2019s Dilworth echoed similar sentiments, noting the increased popularity of low- and no-sugar drinks.\n\u201cMore consumers are gravitating toward zero- and low-calorie energy drinks,\u201d he said in BeverageIndustry\u2019sAugust 2024 issue. \u201cLike in the CSD segment, marketers are downplaying any reference to \u2018diet.\u2019\u201d\nCircana\u2019s Lyons Wyatt noted that energy drinks with no-, low- or less sugar claims grew in dollar sales in the double digits for the previous year.\n\u201c... That is really incredible growth when you\u2019re talking about you know one in 2% volume growth,\u201d she explained. \u201cGetting double digit anything these days is amazing.\u201d\nAside from sugar reduction trends, broader health trends also are impacting the market.\nBMC\u2019s Dilworth noted, in Beverage Industry\u2019s August 2024, a shift in the category toward general health attributes.\n\u201cIt seems that there\u2019s been a slight shift from emphasizing sports drink cues such as branched chain amino acids and more toward general health attributes such as immunity and brain health,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a full-on trend yet, but the direction seems to be toward nootropic and focused energy, particularly as some energy drink consumers grow older.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Mintel\u2019s Riebe noted that functional needs like cognitive enhancement and stress reduction are influencing category innovation.\n\u201cAdditionally, younger consumers are increasingly interested in customizable beverages, including varying caffeine levels, textures and the ability to mix and match flavors,\u201d she said in Beverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue. \u201cGlobally, Gen Z consumers are particularly interested in bold and unique flavor combinations, such as red grape sour watermelon and yuzu flavor combinations. Flavors that borrow from other beverages like Earl Grey, green tea and ginger are also entering the category.\u201d\nRiebe added that in the U.S. market, energy drinks are incorporating flavors that evoke nostalgia and fun like frosted grape, blue raspberry, lollipop and gummy worm.\nCircana\u2019s Lyons Wyatt also noted in Beverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue that candy flavors are popular among younger consumers, with the market also seeing growth with flavors such as mandarin marshmallow, green apple and cherry.\nMarket trends\nAlthough consumer trends continue to prompt innovation within the energy drink category, experts noted that the market is not without its challenges.\n\u201cMany energy drink consumers are mid-to-lower income and a deteriorating economy may cut into sales in the short term,\u201d BMC\u2019s Dilworth said inBeverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue. \u201cEnergy shots continue to be challenged by their limited usage occasions and innovation potential.\u201d\nMintel\u2019s Riebe noted how the market is becoming increasingly competitive with adjacent beverage categories intruding on the energy drinks\u2019 territory by offering similar energy-boosting propositions.\n\u201cThis category blurring intensifies the competition and makes it harder for energy drinks to differentiate themselves,\u201d she explained inBeverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue. \u201cAdditionally, younger consumers like Gen Z and millennials are highly engaged with energy drinks but are also more scrutinizing about the ingredients (i.e., sugar and caffeine levels) and benefits.\u201d\nCircana\u2019s Lyons Wyatt suggested that, because the energy drink category is a young category compared with other categories that have been around for decades, offering a variety of options is key to appealing to a broader base.\n\u201cComing out with varieties that are a little more transparent, that have ingredients that give people options, and that are educating consumers around what these ingredients can do for them, I think those [factors] are so incredibly important,\u201d she said inBeverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue. \u201c\u2026 Yet, at the same time just good old-fashioned energy drinks are seeing solid growth too. So, I think what it\u2019s pointing toward is that the more variety, more types that are out there, then [the category] is going to appeal to a broader base and continue to have growth.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Mintel\u2019s Riebe anticipated continued innovation in flavor, health and functional benefits and the blurring of beverage categories, allowing energy drinks to capture non-traditional occasions.\n\u201cIn the United States, the energy drink market is expected to continue its strong performance, with estimated annual growth between 6-9% over the next five years,\u201d she said inBeverage Industry\u2019s August 2024.\nFor 2024, BMC\u2019s Dilworth noted inBeverage Industry\u2019s August 2024 issue that energy drinks are projected to grow at a 5-6% rate in volume and retail dollars, while energy shots are expected to continue their modest declines.\nMeanwhile, Circana\u2019s Lyons Wyatt suggested that the amount of growth will be dependent on whether the industry continues to innovate, offering varieties of flavors, varieties of sugar options and\u202fvarieties of caffeine options.\n\u201cI think the category will continue to have very strong growth, but it will be dependent on accessibility,\u201d Lyons Wyatt said Beverage Industry\u2019s August 2024.\n\u201c[By] having these drinks available and the varieties available in places where consumers are outdoors, indoors at home, away from home, the [category] will continue to see strong growth for the next few years,\u201d she concluded.\nKEYWORDS: better-for-you beverages energy drinks energy shots performance beverages State of the Beverage Industry\nShare This Story\nLooking for a reprint of this article?

The brand was followed by Heineken in second and Stella Artois ranked third. Compared to all brands worldwide, Budweiser was ranked 32. The top brands in 2019 were all tech companies, with Apple the leader, valued at over 234 billion dollars.\nBrand value\nBrand value is a bit of a nebulous concept and different definitions exist. But, at its core brand value is about how much more people will pay for one brand over another and their likelihood of choosing that brand over another.\nBrand image\nOne component of a brand\u2019s value is its image. More or less the personality of the brand is what comes to consumers\u2019 minds when they think of it. Budweiser has long been famous for its Super Bowl commercials. Their 2017 commercial, #BornTheHardWay garnered nearly half a million shares on social media. Prior to the Super Bowl, Budweiser\u2019s commercial was the most anticipated by viewers.

All over the world, products are imported and enjoyed by millions of consumers. Beers from the United States are enjoyed in bars, sports stadiums, and casinoenvironments, and they are top sellers back home. There are many hundreds of options to choose from, but which is the most valuable brand in 2025?\nThe Perfect Accompaniment\nBeer sales remain buoyant, and the sector is capable of thriving in the most challenging of economies. There will always be an occasion where a beer is the perfect partner, whether it\u2019s on a night out or as a simple accompaniment on a warm day in the backyard.\nWhile there is a choice of bars in every town, beer will also appear on restaurant menus, and it\u2019s widely available in other locations across the country. Traditional styles have been joined by new brews, with the growing craft beer industry adding to the abundant choice. There\u2019s always a time and a place for a beer, and here are some of the most popular and valuable brands on the market today.\nThe Market Leader\nThere is a clear leader at the top of the US beer market, and it isn\u2019t who you might think. In June 2023, Modelo Especial became America\u2019s number one selling product, and in the two years that have followed, it\u2019s widened the gap between itself and the chasing pack. It may not be an obvious candidate because it\u2019s yet to break the overseas market. Other leading brands are readily available across the world, but it\u2019s rare to see a Modelo outside of North America.\nGlobally, a recent survey indicated that Modello was the 455th most valuable brand. The study included all companies, not just beer producers, and Modello was said to be worth $5.2 billion at the time. Brewed in Mexico, Modelo is a success story north of the border, and it\u2019s likely to make greater inroads in other markets very soon.\nFallen From Glory\nWhen Modelo emerged to become the best-selling beer in the United States, the product to lost out was Bud Light. Americans still love to grab a Bud, but they are doing so in fewer numbers since June 2023. Bud Light has since slipped to third place in the sales lists. Before this point, Bud Light had been the best-selling US beer for over twenty years.\nUnfortunately for the producer, a controversial video promoting the brand led to the infamous Bud Light Boycott, and the beer has yet to fully recover. Less than a year later, a report claimed that the advertisement had cost Bud brewer Anheuser-Busch over $1.4 billion in sales. The dip allowed Modello to claim the top spot, but they weren\u2019t the only brand to take advantage.\nBubbling Under\nAs Bud Light slipped down the beer-drinking charts, Michelob Ultra moved in to claim the number two slot. This producer\u2019s sales have grown steadily since it was first brewed in 2002. At that stage, it was introduced as a low-carb option and was viewed as something of a curiosity.\nIn time, the quality won out, and consumers realized that this was simply a great-tasting beer. Michelob Ultra\u2019s sales increased until it became the most popular product from the brewery, while Bud Light\u2019s fall from grace in 2023 allowed it to become number two in the US. As of 2024, it was claimed that Michelob Ultra accounted for around 7.3% of all beer sales at US stores.\nOther Contenders\nWe\u2019ve seen the top three, but many other popular beers are selling in high numbers across the United States. Of those that are imported from overseas, Guinness is a top seller. This Irish stout has a following among expats, but many Americans enjoy this style.\nOther Budweiser and Michelob brews also sell well, while figures are sound for Miller, Coors, Heineken, and Corona. In general, Americans tend to be loyal to their local produce, but as we\u2019ve seen with Modelo, Guinness, and Heineken, there is always room for external produce. As long as it tastes good and doesn\u2019t upset consumers with its style of advertising, it will likely sell well.\nBeer has been produced for thousands of years, and there will always be a demand for such a popular product. It\u2019s an accompaniment for so many different occasions, and Americans will always be loyal to their favorite brews.\nThe shift in sales has been interesting to monitor, and it will be fascinating to see if Bud Light can recover from its 2023 problems. There may also be a certain irony in the fact that a Mexican beer has emerged to become America\u2019s new best seller. There\u2019s plenty of scope for movement in the future, but which brands will emerge to take advantage?\nRecent Stories\n\nWhen Beer Meets Biotech: Exploring Fermentation-Driven Functional

According to a Monday press release from Anheuser-Busch, Michelob Ultra is the No. 1 selling beer in America by volume.\nBud Light, a fellow Anheuser-Busch portfolio member, long held the crown for America\u2019s top-selling beer, but following conservative boycotts over a partnership with influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, sales slipped. In June of that year, Constellation-owned Modelo overtook Bud Light in off-premise dollar sales, a shift that led many to frame it as the \u201cNo. 1\u201d beer in America. After experiencing what seemed like unstoppable growth, however, Modelo has struggled with the ongoing turmoil caused by the Trump Administration\u2019s tariffs. Now, Michelob Ultra has officially taken the top spot in on- and off-premise volume sales. (Modelo remains the number-one beer in off-premise dollar sales, for now.)\nFirst introduced in 2002, Michelob Ultra isn\u2019t a new commodity, but sales volume has ramped up significantly in the past five years. The macro brew has swelled 15 percent since 2020, gaining over two percent of the market share. And now, it\u2019s the country\u2019s top seller.\nAnheuser-Busch cited the most recent round of Circana data, which tracks consumer purchasing behavior for packaged goods in retail channels.

Next year, Michelob Ultra will serve as the official beer of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America as well as the exclusive beer sponsor for the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Milano Cortina. Plus, it will act as the official beer sponsor for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\u201cFor more than 20 years, Michelob Ultra has connected with its fans during the occasions they love. The brand\u2019s playbook has been simple and relentless: invest, learn, and execute as the Official Beer Sponsor of America\u2019s most prominent sports and active-lifestyle moments [\u2026],\u201d Anheuser-Busch chief commercial officer Kyle Norrington remarked. \u201cThis approach has turned Michelob Ultra into an absolute rocket ship, and we\u2019ve got tremendous opportunity ahead of us.\u201d\nVP Pro Take\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long climb to the top for Mich Ultra. From those promising first trials at Arizona country clubs in the aughts to the throne so recently vacated by its erstwhile portfoliomate Bud Light in two decades. It was the category\u2019s first \u2018active lifestyle brand\u2019 before we even really had schlocky buzzwords to describe such a thing. And now it\u2019s the best-selling beer in the country. (I mean, it probably was already, at various points in time over the past few months, but for the vagaries of reporting periods and data compatibility and so forth.)\nThis is hard-fought victory for ABI at a time when it desperately needed one, what with the angst over its efforts to terminate some distributors and pivot towards mega-distributor/-interloper Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine & Spirits, and the generally dogged sales malaise of the trade it has led for six decades. Credit is due to its mighty red network, too, for rallying around Mich Ultra hard after the Bud Light fiasco put rank-and-file distributor workers on the front lines of a culture war that corporate execs at the mothership were fundamentally ill-equipped to fight. (And after the stupendous flop Bud Light Next turned out to be, no less.) So, sure, snaps all around.\nStill, I\u2019d be remiss to ignore the big red Republican elephant in the room. Mich Ultra has been in a dogfight with Modelo Especial for the past couple years, with the two jockeying for the top spot in off-premise dollars since 2023. (ABI\u2019s brands have long had more national depth in the on-premise, though Reyes Beverage Group and other \u2018gold network\u2019 distributors are certainly working on it.) That ABI\u2019s de facto flagship has locked in a lead across channels, format, etc. nine months into 2025 \u2014 the year of federal kidnapping raids on immigrant communities scaring loyal Modelo customers away from America\u2019s beer aisle and Trump\u2019s trade war disrupting the U.S.-Mexican border across which Constellation Brands\u2019 standout lager must flow \u2014 is conspicuous timing indeed. Mich Ultra\u2019s long-term growth has been trending in this direction for years, so it\u2019s not as though its ascent is the direct product of Modelo\u2019s misfortune. But much like the latter beer overtook Bud Light in off-premise dollars sooner than it otherwise might have because ABI let itself get Gamergated by the American right in the summer of 2023, the former beer may have cemented its place at the front of the (six)pack a little faster due to the MAGA of it all two years later.\nHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\u201d \u2014Dave Infante, VinePair columnist and contributing editor\nThis story is a part of VP Pro, our free content platform and newsletter for the drinks industry, covering wine, beer, and liquor \u2014 and beyond.

As I\u2019m sure you know by now, autumn is one of our favorite seasons. To us, this is indisputable. We get goosebumps when fall rolls into town, blowing in its red, orange, and yellow leaves and chilly sweater weather. And nothing beats chilling around the fire with a golden malty yet slightly hoppy beer like a Festbier or a malty German amber lager like a M\u00e4rzen.\nFollowing our wildly successful \u201cThe 27 Most Iconic Beers to Drink in Spring 2024\u201d and \u201cThe 29 Most Iconic Beers to Drink in Summer 2024,\u201d we\u2019re putting together our own version for September, October, and November.\nWelcome to another installment of our series on The Most Iconic Beers to Drink Each Season. For this content, we\u2019ll write about what we feel are the top five styles that pair best with the time of year, identifying the most iconic (and widely available) beer to drink in that style, along with a few other recommendations.\nSo, while this list may look a little shorter than similar seasonal pieces from the past, it will also include more beers accessible to a broader audience.\nBut hey, we\u2019re just giving this a shot.

But by 1872, Spaten Brewery introduced the more amber-hued M\u00e4rzen, which became the official beer of the fest. In the mid-1960s, Paulaner\u2019s golden-colored Oktoberfest Bier, considered a Festbier, began to take over.\nWhich is why we\u2019re kicking off this list with the OG.\nPaulaner Oktoberfest Bier \u2013 Paulaner Brauerei\nMunich, Bayern, Germany\nGraphic courtesy of Derek Campos, Senior Graphic Designer, Next Glass\nFestbier \u2013 Paulaner has brewed its Oktoberfest Bier since 1818, but it actually didn\u2019t gain popularity at the annual celebration until much later.\n\u201cPaulaner brewery is a real traditional Munich brewery and has always played a big part in the history of the city\u2019s culture,\u201d says Christian Dahncke, head brewmaster at Paulaner. \u201c[So Oktoberfest] is an event dear to Paulaner\u2019s heart.\u201d\nToday, Paulaner\u2019s Oktoberfest Bier is the most-served beer at Oktoberfest in Munich. Although still slightly malty, the floralness and spiciness of Noble hops are more prevalent in this style. And they\u2019re somewhat meatier at 6-6.5% ABV. Still light in body, Festbiers are super drinkable and perfect for the two-week-long celebration.\nMeaning you can seek out and pack them in at your leisure even if you didn\u2019t make it to one of beer\u2019s most famous festivals.\nLearn More\nOther Iconic Festbiers to Consider\n\ud83c\udf7bHofbr\u00e4u Oktoberfestbier \u2013 A true Festbier, Oktoberfestbier clocks in at 6.3% ABV, making it a bit bigger than its traditional counterparts. Still, this beer is intimately quaffable. Pouring a shiny gold thanks to light barley and Munich malts, Hofbrau\u2019s version feels soft on the palate. The slightly sweet finish gets you ready to go in instantly for another sip. This is the beer you want alongside some of that traditional Oktoberfest roast chicken.\nBuy This Beer\n\ud83c\udf7bWeihenstephaner Festbier \u2013 Although technically not one of the big six Munich breweries, Weihenstephan still makes \u201ca beer that truly represents the Bavarian way of celebrating.\u201d Pouring a deep gold, Weihenstephaner Festbier is a full-bodied, rich seasonal lager that you can only find during Festbier season.\nAnd we\u2019ve got it right here for you.\nBuy This Beer\n\ud83c\udf7bHuman Robot Festbier \u2013 One of the \u201cBest Beers We Drank in 2023,\u201d we featured Human Robot\u2019s Festbier in our best-selling Oktoberfest box last year and this year. Our social media manager, Magic Muncie, who got a bunch of these beers sent to him to shoot for the \u2018Gram, kindly drove some down to Hop Culture Senior Content Editor Grace Lee-Weitz (he only lives about an hour and a half north of her).\nWe\u2019re huge Human Robot fans; the brewery is definitely on our must-visit list if we ever make it to Philly one of these days. Instead of traveling coast to coast, getting our hands on Human Robot\u2019s eponymous Festbier was the next best thing.\nLook, over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve tasted a lot of Festbiers for this annual piece. Candidly, along with M\u00e4rzens, it\u2019s one of our favorite fall styles.\nHuman Robot\u2019s is unparalleled, which is probably why it ranks as Untappd\u2019s fifth highest-rated Festbier of all time!\nHuman Robot puts its Festbier through an intense process, including a double-decoction mash along with a slow, cold fermentation.\nYou can taste the dedication. We get a lovely light buttery RITZ Cracker backbone from the German pilsner and Munich malt (plus the decoction step just has this incredible way of smoothly bringing out the rustic edges of malt, if that makes sense). The first sip gives way to a honied sweetness and finally a bite of Herbrucker bitterness.\nThis beer just has its st together but in such a humble way. It\u2019s not outshining anyone, it\u2019s not asking for the spotlight, it\u2019s just quietly, tightly buttoned up to a T. It\u2019s excellent lager craftsmanship at its finest.\n\ud83c\udf7bJack\u2019s Abby Copper Legend \u2013 When Oktoberfest rolls around each fall, Jack\u2019s Abby Copper Legend becomes a staple in our beer fridge. Mainly because it\u2019s such an excellent expression of the Festbier style. Probably because Jack\u2019s Abby Brewmaster Jack Hendler painstakingly aims for his German beers to match the traditional styles. Smooth, malty, and super quaffable, Copper Legend is a go-to.\nBuy This Beer\n\ud83c\udf7bSchilling G\u2019suffa! \u2013 Landing sixth on Untappd\u2019s All-Time Top-Rated Festbier list, Schilling\u2019s G\u2019Suffa! reminds us of revelry or, as they like to say in Munich, \u201cOans, zwo, drei, g\u2019suffa!\u201d Schilling\u2019s annual Festbier release just puts a smile on our faces.\nPouring clear-as-a-bell gold, the Festbier includes Weyermann Bohemian Pilsner and Vienna malts for that chewy grain goodness, followed by Bavarian Saphir and Amira from HVG Hops for that light potpourri counterbalance.\nThe lager-heavy brewery sounds G\u2019Suffa for natural carbonation for a beer that\u2019s equal parts malty, floral, and all good times.\nM\u00e4rzen\nAs we mentioned, when Spaten brewed the first M\u00e4rzen in 1872, it became the official beer of Oktoberfest in Munich.\nThese German amber lagers, typically anywhere from chestnut to russet in color, hit the palate as smooth, toasty, bready, and slightly spiced with a bit of a Noble hop bite.\nM\u00e4rzens clock in around 5-6% ABV with a dry finish.\nIn America, M\u00e4rzens are the most common style of what we\u2019ve come to call Oktoberfest or Oktoberfest-style beers.\nSpaten Oktoberfest Ur-M\u00e4rzen \u2013 Spaten\nMunich, Bayern, Germany\nGraphic courtesy of Derek Campos, Senior Graphic Designer, Next Glass\nCreated in 1872, Spaten Oktoberfest is considered the world\u2019s first M\u00e4rzen. Towing a lustrous line between amber and gold, this version boasts deep, toasty notes complemented by a crisp citrus lemon bite. Simply put, this version from Spaten is not to be missed. Luckily, it\u2019s pretty readily available here in the U.S. Just be careful not to confuse this M\u00e4rzen with Spaten\u2019s golden Oktoberfestbier, only available in Germany. The Mayor of Munich kicks off the official Oktoberfest celebration by tapping a keg of Spaten Oktoberfestbier. So, unless you travel to Munich, you won\u2019t be able to try Oktoberfestbier, but Spaten Oktoberfest is an amazing alternative.\nBuy This Beer\nOther Iconic M\u00e4rzens to Consider\n\ud83c\udf7bHacker-Pschorr Original Amber M\u00e4rzen \u2013 Brewed in reverence to the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516, known as Reinheitsgebot, the Original Oktoberfest Amber M\u00e4rzen from Hacker-Pschorr is a perennial favorite. Amber in color and stunningly smooth, this m\u00e4rzen stands for everything the style represents\u2014a perfect marriage of sweetness and maltiness.\n\ud83c\udf7b3 Floyds Munsterfest \u2013 A tribute to German brewing, Munsterfest uses only German malted barley, Bavarian noble hops, and traditional lager yeast. You\u2019d expect 3 Floyds to go a little crazy and over-the-top with their version of a M\u00e4rzen, but really, everything stays pretty classic here. Well, except for the artwork, which in itself blows our minds. Amber, toasty, and roasty, Munsterfest won\u2019t melt your brain, but it will certainly keep you smiling all through the fall. Which is why we named it one of our \u201cTop 31 Oktoberfest Beers to Try in 2024.\u201d\nBUY BEER HERE\n\ud83c\udf7bBierstadt Lagerhaus Oktoberfest \u2013 A beer that garnered a ninety-six from Craft Beer & Brewing and landed third on Untappd\u2019s All-Time Top-Rated M\u00e4rzens, Oktoberfest from Bierstadt Lagerhaus has a \u201crestrained aroma of light, sweet caramel, and a light zesty quality that emerges as it warms,\u201d writes the panel. Expertly malty with just a bit of Noble hop bite, Bierstadt\u2019s Oktoberfest is the perfect reincarnation of the traditional German style. We wouldn\u2019t expect anything less.\n\ud83c\udf7bvon Trapp Oktoberfest \u2013 At this idyllic brewery in Stowe, VT, the hills are always alive with the fresh taste of helles. But, when fall rolls around at the brewery owned by the same family portrayed in The Sound of Music, calls for Oktoberfest can be heard from the peaks\u2019 tippy tops.\nFeaturing a blend of light and dark Munich malts, von Trapp\u2019s Oktoberfest contrasts that malty almost s\u2019mores-like backbone with the floral, peppery Hallertau and Tettnang hops.\nAs the brewery writes in the beer\u2019s Untappd description, \u201cSay \u2018Prost\u2019 with this crisp and celebratory lager.\u201d\n\ud83c\udf7bGoldfinger Oktoberfest Ur-M\u00e4rzen \u2013 To make Oktoberfest Ur-M\u00e4rzen, which ranks in the top ten on the list of Untappd\u2019s All-Time Top-Rated M\u00e4rzens, Goldfinger stays as faithful to traditional M\u00e4rzen brewing as possible. Which means that yes, they brew this beer in March, and yes, they tie up one of their lagering tanks to cold condition for six months until September. At this point, Goldfinger\u2019s German lager is nice and ready for Oktoberfest. But this also means that Goldfinger only brews a certain amount, and once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone! Get this one while you can.\nRauchbier or Smoked Beer\nAll beer was once smoked beer or rauchbier in German. \u201cIt\u2019s a lost knowledge that smoke beer was the original way of making beer,\u201d Sixth Generation \u201cHeller-Br\u00e4u\u201d Trum, more commonly known as Schlenkerla, Brewmaster Matthias Trum tells us from his childhood bedroom above the historic smoked beer tavern in Bamberg, Germany.\nToday, Schlenkerla is known as one of the quintessential smoked beer breweries, continuing an art bred from history but lost to innovation.\nRauchbier, which literally translates to \u201csmoked beer\u201d in German, gets its distinct campfire-like flavor from drying malt in a kiln fueled most commonly by Beechwood.\nThe polarizing style has a fascinating, if slightly smoky, history, surviving near extinction thanks partly to Schlenkerla in the Bavarian region of Germany.\nIf you want to read all about it, head here. If you just want to know the best ones to drink, keep reading below\u2026\nREAD THE HISTORY OF RAUCHBIER\nAecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier \u2013 M\u00e4rzen \u2013 Schlenkerla (\u201cHeller-Br\u00e4u\u201d Trum)\nBamberg, Bayern, Germany\nGraphic courtesy of Derek Campos, Senior Graphic Designer, Next Glass\nOne of the most classic interpretations of the style still alive today, Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier has to be at the top of your must-try rauchbier list.\nThis beer has quite a history, surviving near extinction. And when the smoke cleared, this smoked beer made a place for itself in local lore.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old Bamberg proverb that when you drink smoked beer \u2026 you have to drink three pints to fully appreciate the aroma and flavor,\u201d says Trum, sixth-generation brewer.\nArguably the most classic example of the style, Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier is a dark, aromatic, bottom-fermented 5.1% ABV lager\u2014essentially a smoked M\u00e4rzen\u2014brewed with Original Schlenkerla Smokemalt and tapped according to the old tradition directly from the gravity-fed oakwood cask in the fourteenth-century brewery tavern.\n\u201cThe classic M\u00e4rzen smoked beer is made with (basically) 100 percent smoked malt and a tiny bit of roast malt to fill out the color differences between malt batches,\u201d says Trum, \u201cbecause obviously with an open fire, you cannot adjust the color as exactly as in a modern kiln.\u201d\nWhile brewing, Schlenkerla uses a decoction mash to emphasize the malt\u2019s unique notes. \u201cBy boiling the mash, you add additional flavors, and you get a more intense and more bread-like aroma in the beer,\u201d explains Trum.\nThe classic M\u00e4rzen smoked beer lagers for two months before it\u2019s ready to drink fresh out of wooden barrels in the tavern, which, if you follow Trum\u2019s advice, is the best place in the world to drink it.\n\u201dWhen you sit on a chair which has been around for 100 years, the table 150 years, and the room around you is 500 years old,\u201d Trum emphasizes, and drink an Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier right from the wooden barrel, well, that will never get old.\nBut we understand drinking straight from the gravity-fed wooden cask at Schlenkerla\u2019s tavern isn\u2019t always possible.\nLuckily, you can find this beer distributed pretty widely throughout the United States.\nAlthough maybe consider planning a trip for next year\u2026I know we are. \ud83d\ude09\nRead More\nOther Iconic Rauchbiers or Smoked Beers to Consider\n\ud83c\udf7bSpezial Rauchbier Lager \u2013 Hop Culture Freelancer Ryan Pachmayer, who traveled to the Franconia region, put together this excellent guide for us. In addition to Schlenkerla, he suggests visiting the other historic rauchbier brewery, Spezial.\nHe writes, \u201cWhile both have an old-world charm, the beers are remarkably different. Schlenkerla\u2019s beers have a more pronounced, deeper smoke flavor, while Spezial\u2019s beers have an almost delicate smoke flavor.\u201d\n\ud83c\udf7bDovetail Rauchbier \u2013 Brewed year-round, Dovetail\u2019s Rauchbier is a revelation and probably one of our favorite versions made Stateside.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a chocolate bar with the smoke in the beer with a sea salt flavor,\u201d explains Dovetail Brewery Brewer and Marketing and Creative Manager Jenny Pfafflin. \u201cIt\u2019s savory sweet but not a sweet beer because it has a lot of bread crust.\u201d\nDovetail stays close to Schlenkerla-esque percentages with ninety-five percent Beechwood smoked malt and a little chocolate malt. \u201cPeople are usually shocked to find that much smoked malt,\u201d says Pfafflin, noting they also double decoct to \u201cthrottle up that maltiness, which balances out the smoke.\u201d\nWhile the smoke does dominate, Pfafflin says Dovetail also adds complexity with Tettnang hops.\n\u201cWe do a coolship addition as well as hot-side hopping, so you\u2019re getting more of an herbally hop character,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the herbalism and hoppiness that helps balance the beer, the smoke, and the malt.\u201d\n\ud83c\udf7bBarrique Brewing & Blending Rauchbier \u2013 To make Barrique\u2019s Rauchbier, Barrique\u2019s Head Brewer Spencer Longhurst typically starts with forty-three percent of Weyermann\u2019s smoked Beechwood malt before adding Munich I and Munich II and a tiny bit of chocolate malt just for color adjustment.\n\u201cI work everything backward from there,\u201d he shares. Since he tries to keep Barrique\u2019s version style-specific, in this case, a M\u00e4rzen, Longhurst isn\u2019t looking for a defined hop character.\n\u201cJust enough bitterness to balance some of the sweetness and the malt depth,\u201d he explains. Barrique uses German Tradition through two additions. \u201cAt first wort and one with thirty minutes remaining in the boil for 18.5 IBUs,\u201d says Longhurst. \u201cNot a great deal of consideration in the hops; it\u2019s just to balance.\u201d\nLonghurst then lagers the rauchbier for nine weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s about two weeks in the primary fermenter and then about six to seven weeks lagering and packaging,\u201d he says.\nThe result speaks for itself.\nLonghurst describes the beer as pouring a deep, dark amber with an aroma like \u201ca gentle campfire, almost hammy. I don\u2019t want to say barbecue \u2026 but maybe more like Black Forest ham.\u201d\nThe sweet, smoky aromatics carry through to the sip fivefold. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a lot more smoky on the palate than the aroma,\u201d says Longhurst. \u201cIt\u2019s got that bread, multigrain complexity, and then you swallow, and you get this drying smoke effect.\u201d\nHe adds, \u201cIt\u2019s a cool beer.\u201d\nSeems like people agree. This beer ranks ninth on Untappd\u2019s list of all-time top-rated rauchbiers.\nVienna Lager\nThese copper-hued, malt-forward lagers can be hard to find. Partly because it\u2019s a more challenging beer to produce\u2014it takes longer to ferment, and there\u2019s really nowhere for off-flavors to hide. And often, even if a beer is technically classified as a Vienna lager, breweries often opt to call it by another name for marketing reasons. For example, in the case of Sam Adams, a Boston lager.\nHop Culture Freelancer Bailey Berg reported on Vienna lagers for us a few years ago. In her words:\nAs the story goes, sometime around the 1820s and \u201830s, Anton Dreher, owner of Brauhaus zu Klein-Schwechat in Austria, along with his buddy and fellow brewer, Gabriel Sedlmayr, went on a beer tour of Europe. They made stops at breweries across the continent but spent most of their time in Britain, sampling the suds and working as they went.\n\u201cAs lagers were getting started, everybody was looking at Britain. At the time, British brewing technology was on fire,\u201d said Jason Ranck, Neshaminy Creek Brewing head brewer, who won medals in the Vienna Lager category at the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) in 2013 and 2016.\nThey also \u201cborrowed\u201d beer.\n\u201cThe story is that they would go to these breweries with a hollowed-out cane that they\u2019d steal samples with, so they could bring them back to Germany to study [at the brewery Sedlmayr\u2019s family worked at (Spaten)],\u201d says Ranck.\nBeyond stealing wort, the duo learned how to use technology that hadn\u2019t yet made its way to Central Europe\u2014techniques such as chilling hot wort to bring it quickly to yeast-pitching temperatures and understanding how to sanitize equipment better.\nBut Dreher\u2019s true claim to fame? He pivoted from brewing top-fermented beer (ales) to bottom-fermented beer (lagers).\nIn 1841, Dreher released the bottom-fermented \u201cKlein-Schwechater Lagerbier,\u201d which would soon be called Vienna Lager. It was an immediate hit, earning him the title \u201cthe beer king.\u201d\nPeople loved Dreher\u2019s Vienna Lager because it was comparatively light-colored to other beers at the time.\n\u201cEven though we think of Viennas as amberish-colored beers, at the time, it would have been the lightest beer anyone had ever seen, so it would have been dazzling,\u201d says Ranck.\nToday, the Brewers Association defines a true-to-style Vienna lager as copper to reddish-brown in color and clear in clarity. These are medium-bodied beers with low hop aroma and bitterness, a malty aroma, and light malt sweetness.\nBrooklyn Lager \u2013 Brooklyn Brewery\nBrooklyn, NY\nGraphic courtesy of Derek Campos, Senior Graphic Designer, Next Glass\nBrooklyn Lager, the beer that started everything at Brooklyn Brewery, represented innovation at its finest over thirty-five years ago. Co-founders Steve Hindy and Tom Potter began Brooklyn Brewery to return Brooklyn to its heyday of brewing pre-prohibition.\nNow one of the most iconic breweries in America, Brooklyn Brewery continues the tradition with beers like the award-winning Brooklyn Lager, which earned gold for American Amber Lager at the 2018 World Beer Cup.\nFirst introduced in the late \u201880s, Brooklyn Lager improved under the guidance of Brooklyn Brewery Brewmaster Garrett Oliver when he joined the team in 1994.\nQuite simply, Brooklyn Lager tasted and looked different from every other beer on shelves at the turn of the century.\n\u201cBack in 1988, most people had never seen a beer that wasn\u2019t pale yellow and virtually flavorless\u2014the deep color and bold flavor of Brooklyn Lager was quite a shock,\u201d said Oliver in a press release. \u201cOnce people tasted a few pints, though, they never wanted to be without it again. \u2026 I actually like to think it\u2019s become \u2018even more like itself.\u2019 What I mean by that is that, although the recipe has barely changed over the years, we now have [over] 35 years of experience brewing Brooklyn Lager, so the beer is better than ever.\u201d\nCaramel-forward with a refreshing dry-hopped aroma, Brooklyn Lager is a true testament to Vienna lagers.\nBuy This Beer\nOther Iconic Vienna Lagers to Consider\n\ud83c\udf7bSamuel Adams Boston Lager \u2013 Back when the term craft beer didn\u2019t exist, when imports and American light lagers dominated, Boston Beer Co. Founder Jim Koch homebrewed his great-grandfather\u2019s recipe, passed down to him from his dad, in his kitchen.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know beer could taste that way,\u201d says Koch, who sourced the ingredients and supplies from a homebrew warehouse in the back of a canoe store in Framingham, MA, along with a supply depot a guy ran out of his garage.\nA fairly difficult process involving brewing techniques like decoction and krausening (adding fresh wort to beer before, during, or after fermentation to carbonate the beer), Koch couldn\u2019t replicate the recipe completely. \u201cBut when I first tasted it, it was like, oh, wow, I\u2019ve never had this before,\u201d Koch recalls. \u201cThe amount of flavor and complexity of the flavor and the balance of the flavor were exquisite.\u201d\nKoch knew he had created something special. He just didn\u2019t know yet that he had created something revolutionary.\nLaunching on Patriot\u2019s Day (April 15th) in 1985, Boston Beer touted its flagship Samuel Adams Boston Lager to the masses in Massachusetts.\nA bottom-fermented beer in a land of top-fermented ones, Boston Lager gave drinkers \u201cthis wonderful balance between the body and sweetness of the malt and the spiciness and bitterness of the hops,\u201d says Koch.\nUnlike any other lager out there, Boston Lager picked up a nod from the nascent Great American Beer Festival (GABF) as the best beer in America a mere four months after it hit the market.\n\u201cI realized I wasn\u2019t the only one who thought this was something unique and special,\u201d says Koch. \u201c[This beer] helped ignite the whole craft beer revolution.\u201d\nBoston Beer Co. Assistant Manager of New Product Development Rich Ferrell calls it \u201cthe right beer at the right place at the right time.\u201d\nKoch dropped Boston Lager into Boston, a city steeped in history, with a name and symbol drawing on American traditions. He also launched the Vienna lager right at the crux of a nascent craft movement. And, honestly, he brewed a damn fine beer toeing the line between crafty complexity and beautiful balance.\n\u201cThis is a beer that is American, should be made in America, and we\u2019re going to name it after this revolutionary [person],\u201d explains Eryn Bottens, Boston Beer Co.\u2019s brewing manager of new product development. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start a craft beer revolution.\u201d\nAnd Koch did. Whether intentionally or not, he fired Boston Lager out of a cannon with a resounding boom that has echoed for decades.\nToday, Samuel Adams Boston Lager remains one of America\u2019s most revolutionary beers (and Vienna lagers).\nRead More\n\ud83c\udf7bGoldfinger Danube Swabian \u2013 At Goldfinger, lagers are lifeblood, literally.  It\u2019s basically all they do and goes back to owner and brewer Tom Beckmann\u2019s Polish roots. His family actually brewed professionally and manufactured brewing equipment in Poland and the Czech Republic during the nineteenth century. A fact he learned after looking into his heritage on ancestry.com and reconnecting with relatives still in Central Europe.\nGoldfinger launched in July 2020 with only three beers\u2014all lagers\u2014including the Original Lager, Pils, and Vienna Lager.\nWhile the brewery\u2019s original Vienna Lager ranks as the third-highest on Untappd\u2019s all-time top-rated versions, it\u2019s a specialty version that actually takes the top spot and is rated second-highest according to the Untappd Community Awards, which celebrated the thousands of great breweries and beers rated as best-in-class by the app\u2019s eleven million users in 2023.\nA spin on Goldfinger\u2019s original Vienna Lager, Danube Swabian takes historical inspiration from a book Beckmann read called Vienna Lager by Andreas Krennmair.\n\u201cHe talks about some of the early malts used to make the very first Vienna lagers, and just so happens the heirloom variety is this Han\u00e1 Bohemian-grown variety that had been resurrected by a local maltster of ours in Indiana,\u201d explains Beckmann, who called up Sugar Creek Malt to see if they could kiln this Han\u00e1 variety to Vienna specs. \u201cWe were the first ones to use that malt.\u201d\nBeckmann says the first time they brewed Danube Swabian, \u201cit performed very well and was absolutely delicious!\u201d\nRead More\n\ud83c\udf7bChuckanut Vienna Lager \u2013 The famed lager brewery, of course, makes an excellent Vienna lager with some serious accolades: multiple gold and silver GABF wins, three North American Beer Awards silvers, and a bronze, silver, and gold at the Washington Beer Awards. Why? Because it\u2019s supremely delicate, crisp, and well-balanced, with lightly roasted malt and caramel notes. All in all, it\u2019s an actual beer that\u2019s indicative of the style.\n\ud83c\udf7bSuarez Family Fundamental \u2013 The fourth highest-rated Vienna lager on Untappd\u2019s list of the all-time best, Fundamental is an unfiltered version with an excellent balance of maltiness and a whisper of hops.\n\ud83c\udf7bBurial Beer Co. Rust \u2013 One of our \u201c10 Best Beers We Drank in January 2023,\u201d Rust impressed us in its simplicity. Beneath the incredibly long names and hyperbolic descriptions, you find simple, solid, incredibly well-made styles. And yes, they\u2019re usually of the hazy or IPA variety, which is why we were pleasantly surprised to see a Vienna-style lager in a package the Asheville-based brewery sent us last year.\nAnd lo and behold, this one had a straightforward name. In fact, it\u2019s just one word: rust.\nReally, that word says it all.\nPouring a beautiful garnet-ruby-rust red, Rust gives off this earthy, almost bitter espresso-like aroma.\nSip this one, and a bit of cocoa and dark chocolate bitterness will hit you on the tongue. Then a predominant roast coffee carousel whips you wildly around past blurs of caramel and malt, thanks to the German Pils and Vienna malts (and only these two malts) that Burial uses.\nThat and a time-consuming decoction as only a proper Vienna lager should enjoy. A low-and-slow fermentation builds the flavor and carbonation, so when you drink Rust, you get a beer that has aged over time. Some might say, like\u2026rust.\nBurial describes this beer on its Untappd page as \u201crising loaves of country rye bread coated in caramel butter and zested with fresh lemon.\u201d\n\ud83c\udf7bvon Trapp Vienna Style Lager \u2013 Much like Goldfinger, von Trapp opened with three core beers\u2014Helles, Dunkel, and Vienna Style Lager. According to the beer\u2019s Untappd description, Vienna Style lager was named for the city where the signature style was born. This Austrian-style amber lager has malt notes of bread crust, toffee, and toast combined with a grassy and floral hop bouquet, making for a balanced and full-flavored drinking experience.\nBuy This Beer\nPumpkin Beer\nWe\u2019re still not sure if pumpkin beers make us feel like Cinderella as the belle of the ball or like turning into a pumpkin at midnight. Everyone has their own opinion. Regardless, somehow, the debate over this polarizing style continues to live on well past midnight each year. Like Thanos, they\u2019ve become inevitable.\nCresting in the early 2010s, the category simply isn\u2019t peaking anymore.\nAccording to Untappd, the world\u2019s largest social networking platform for beer, check-ins for pumpkin beers peaked in 2021 at almost 600k and decreased to 437k last year.\nWhen analyzing the current pumpkin beer market, 3 Tier Beverage Consultant Mary Mills shared, \u201cPumpkin flavor experienced measurable growth a few years back: It jumped from $6 million in 2021 to $30 million in 2022 and then leveled off.\u201d In the last 52 weeks (through August 10, 2024), according to NIQ, pumpkin flavor fell 22.5% across all pack sizes and types.\nBut pumpkin beer hasn\u2019t wholly disappeared.\nElysian Brewing, the largest purveyor of pumpkin beer in the U.S., has brewed 100 pumpkin beers over two decades. Each fall, the Seattle-based brewery releases a Pumpkin Pack featuring four varieties.\nAccording to Elysian Senior Home Market Brand Manager Josie Redmond, its variety pack is the number-two pumpkin item in dollar and volume sales total in the U.S. to date through August 2024, making up 10% of total cases sold of pumpkin beer across the U.S.\nWhen asked about the future of pumpkin beer, Elysian Brewing Innovation Manager Brian Wold didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cTo spread to the nation that pumpkin beer can work,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are committed to pumpkin.\u201d\nHonestly, they\u2019re not alone. Many breweries are the boss of squash.\nJust look at a few examples reliably returning each autumn\u2026\nPumking \u2013 Southern Tier Brewing Company\nLakewood, NY\nGraphic courtesy of Derek Campos, Senior Graphic Designer, Next Glass\nOne of the most widely available\u2014and indeed the earliest to market each year\u2014Southern Tier Pumking is available right now. It wouldn\u2019t be fall for a pumpkin beer drinker without a glass of this all-spiced concoction.\nPumpkin puree and pie spices combine for a classic malty, bready, cinnamony pumpkin beer with some additional notes of nutmeg and vanilla.\nBuy This Beer\nOther Iconic Pumpkin Beers to Consider\n\ud83c\udf7bElysian The Great Pumpkin \u2013 Each October for the last twenty years, Seattle-based Elysian Brewing hosted its Great Pumpkin Beer Festival. The experts on pumpkin beer have brewed over 100 pumpkin beers in the brewery\u2019s entire twenty-five-year history, including the world\u2019s first imperial pumpkin ale\u2014The Great Pumpkin.\nFresh off winning gold at the 2024 Great American Beer Festival Awards in the \u201cPumpkin Beer\u201d category, The Great Pumpkin continues to impress.\nBoasting intense aromas of pumpkin with sugar and spice on the nose, this pumpkin beer presents all the flavors of pumpkin pie in a glass, making it the perfect brew to indulge in throughout the season. This delectably smooth fall brew pours a deep copper color with a ghostly white head.\nRead More\n\ud83c\udf7bSaint Arnold Pumpkinator Aged in Bourbon Barrels (2020) \u2013 Of the top ten spots on the list of Untappd\u2019s All-Time Top-Rated Pumpkin/Yam Beers, Saint Arnold nabbed six, including the top two spots. The purveyor of pumpkin beer\u2019s Pumpkinator Aged in Bourbon Barrels (2020) slips into second with an average of 4.23 from 1,483 ratings.\nThis version of Pumpkinator ages in Woodford Reserve barrels for almost thirteen months.\nYou can expect similar notes of oak, bourbon, vanilla, and dark fruit.\nSaint Arnold said, \u201cIt\u2019s even bigger than the original!\u201d With a 12.9% ABV, we believe it.\n\ud83c\udf7bNew Belgium Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin \u2013 In 2017, this pioneering brewery relaunched its core portfolio, introducing Voodoo Ranger as one of its flagships.\nAccording to New Belgium, Voodoo Ranger normally represents a series of IPAs \u201cbrewed with trendsetting hop and malt varieties\u2014and served with a side of sarcasm.\u201d\nBut come the fall, Voodoo Ranger veers left. New Belgium\u2019s take on pumpkin beers includes cinnamon and a surprise addition of habanero chili peppers for \u201cjust the right amount of heat,\u201d according to New Belgium.\nWe see where the \u201catomic\u201d kicks in here!\nMaking this version utterly antithetical to the pumpkin beer oeuvre, Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin stands more as a vision of future pumpkin beers as opposed to the sometimes stale shelf they\u2019ve fallen to in the past.\n\ud83c\udf7bDogfish Head Punkin Ale \u2013 Fun fact: Dogfish Head\u2019s Punkin Ale remains the brewery\u2019s best-selling seasonal. The color here to keep in mind is brown instead of orange. A full-bodied brown ale, Punkin Ale gets hit with a truckload of brown sugar, warming spices, and pumpkin meat for \u201cthe perfect beer to warm up with,\u201d according to Dogfish Head.\nFor us, this one is a classic that we consider a gateway to other pumpkin beers. Sure, maybe it\u2019s a creaky cemetery gate squeaking in the wind.\n\ud83c\udf7bBuffalo Bill\u2019s America\u2019s Original Pumpkin Ale  \u2013 Technically considered the first pumpkin ale, America\u2019s Original Pumpkin Ale came onto the scene in 1985. For the last almost forty years, the iconic pumpkin beer has become a fall tradition. According to the brewery, much of Buffalo Bill\u2019s acclaim originates from this beloved autumn brew, which is made with real pumpkin and spices. Pouring a golden amber color, America\u2019s Original Pumpkin Ale has the sweet aroma of warm pumpkin pie.\nAbout The Author\n### Hop Culture\nRelated Articles\n### 14 Most Iconic Beers We\u2019re Drinking to Celebrate National Beer Day\n### 21 Most Iconic American Breweries to Cheers on National Beer Day\n### The 29 Most Iconic Beers to Drink in Summer 2024"

I shared beers with friends several times and attended the Rare and Vintage Beer Tasting in Durham which was filled with superb beers. In total I tried 117 different beers in January, and here are the best:\n\n\u0110\u1ea5t Ph\u00fac from CLAG Brewing Company in Sandusky, OH\nThis is a Pastry Stout with Wild Thai banana, toasted coconut, and Bissell Farms maple syrup. These are three of my favorite adjuncts in general, so it is no surprise that this was a banger for me.

Eunoia Batch 18 is a blend of base stout aged from 19 to 37 months aged in heaven hill, wild turkey, and willett bourbon barrels and aged it on over 800 pounds of raw and toasted coconut. The coconut exudes out of this beer in the most delightful way. Eunoia is always a stellar beer, but this just might be my favorite yet!\n\nImprint collaboration brew from Root + Branch Brewingin Copiague, NY and TEST Brewery in Brooklyn, NY\nImprint is a multi-oat/wheat Triple IPA brewed and dry hopped with Freestyle Nelson hops. A superb Hazy brewed from two incredible breweries in New York!\n\nThe 12 - A Reworking from Lesser-Known Beer Company in Winston-Salem, NC\nThe 12 is a Czech Pale Lager that is exactly what you\u2019re looking for in a Lager. Way too easy to drink, refreshing, flavorful, and overall perfection.

Triple dry-hopped with Citra, Nelson and Motueka, and finished with Citra Cryo. Their ability to continuously put out insane beers never ceases to amaze me!\n\nYodel: Nelson from Freak Folk Bier in Waterbury, VT\nYodel: Nelson is a Double Dry Hopped Double IPA with 100% Nelson hops.

This is a fluffy marshmallow joyful experience from start to finish.\n\n7 Deadly Stouts from Monday Night Brewing in Atlanta, GA\nSeven Deadly Stouts is a blend of imperial stout aged in 7 different spirit barrels for over 2 years. Apple Brandy, Bourbon, Scotch, Maple Bourbon, Tequila, Rum, and Cognac barrels were all blended together and aged upon massive amounts of toasted coconut, hazelnuts, coffee, cinnamon, chocolate, and vanilla beans. This is a very barrel-forward beer that surprised me how well all of these things worked well together.\n\nSomething We Could No Longer Contain from Fidens Brewing in Albany, NY\nSomething We Could No Longer Contain is Triple IPA with Simcoe, Citra and Idaho 7 hops.

Honestly this one surprised me with how good it was. Pinthouse is not a brewery whose beers I have previously sought out after having a couple of flights during Austin visits where my conclusions were basically \u201csolid, but nothing crazy\u201d.

The investment will go toward upgrading brewing and packaging equipment to fuel increased production of Michelob ULTRA, America\u2019s #1 top-selling and fastest-growing beer.\nThis latest $7.4 million investment in its Los Angeles Brewery is part of Anheuser-Busch\u2019s ongoing Brewing Futures initiative, through which the company is investing more than $300 million in its U.S. facilities to create and sustain U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nBrendan Whitworth, CEO, Anheuser-Busch, said: \u201cInvesting in our Los Angeles Brewery enables us to brew and deliver more of the highest-quality beers and beyond that consumers love \u2013 including Michelob ULTRA, the #1 top-selling and fastest-growing beer in America. Investments like this one strengthen our position as a leading American manufacturer, allowing us to continue driving economic growth and creating and sustaining jobs in the communities where we operate.\u201d\nAnheuser-Busch opened its Los Angeles Brewery in 1954. The company has invested $180 million in the brewery over the past five years, part of the nearly $2 billion it has invested in its 100 U.S. facilities over the past five years.\nCaroline Menjivar, California State Senator - 20th District, said: \u201cSince opening its doors over 70 years ago in Van Nuys, Anheuser-Busch has played a foundational and generational role in economic growth, employment, and business innovation for the district and constituents I now represent in the San Fernando Valley. This new $7.4 million investment will only further contribute to the success of our community, keeping jobs in Senate District 20 at a time when so many are commuting far for good paying jobs. I am grateful to Anheuser-Busch for their continued partnership with the people of San Fernando Valley.\u201d\nAnheuser-Busch makes 45 different high-quality products at its Los Angeles Brewery, which are then shipped across the country to 26 U.S. states. This investment will expand the brewery\u2019s capacity to produce fast-growing brands like Michelob ULTRA, including producing 25-oz cans and 15-pack slim cans to meet growing consumer demand. Single-serve cans are the #1 share gaining pack-size in beer this year (Nielsen IQ All Off-Premise Outlets Total US YTD w.e 8/16/25), with Michelob Ultra growing 7.2% in volume year-to-date. (Circana MULC YTD w.e. 8/31/25).\nFor over 20 years, Michelob ULTRA has been synonymous with championing an active lifestyle. Through investments like this one in Los Angeles, which purchases more Michelob ULTRA than any other city in the U.S. (Circana MULC YTD Volume w.e. 9/14/25), Anheuser-Busch is committed to fueling the brand\u2019s momentum and supporting increasing consumer demand. Michelob ULTRA is also the official beer sponsor of the 2026 FIFA World Cup\u2122 and 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games \u2013 major global sporting events coming to Los Angeles.\nBuilding on more than 165 years of continuous investment in its people, breweries, and communities, Anheuser-Busch's Brewing Futures initiative supports American manufacturing through three key pillars:\n1) creating and sustaining manufacturing jobs\n2) advancing technical skills training\n3) strengthening manufacturing career opportunities for veterans.\nABOUT ANHEUSER-BUSCH\nAt Anheuser-Busch, our purpose is to create a future with more cheers. For more than 165 years, we have delivered a legacy of brewing great-tasting, high-quality beers that have satisfied beer drinkers for generations. 99 percent of the products we sell in the U.S are made in the U.S. with more than $700 million in high-quality ingredients sourced from American farmers and more than $7 billion in goods and services purchased from U.S. suppliers, and we have invested nearly $2 billion in our 100 facilities across the country over the past five years. Through these investments, and as a leading American manufacturer and the nation\u2019s top brewer, we drive economic prosperity nationwide through investments in our people, facilities, and communities.

        "raw_content": "Best Fall Beers of 2025\nPublished on August 7th 2025 by SNBC\nFall arrives at different times. Our brewery team in Mills River, NC is throwing on hoodies while we\u2019re still blasting the A/C in Chico, CA. Eventually we all find ourselves noting the crisp breeze, changing leaves, and cravings for food and drink that anchor us against the elements. Summer salads turn to hearty soups, and your go-to beers might make a shift.\nTop Fall Beer Styles to Try This Season\nSome say autumn is all about dark, malty ales \u2014 which we love; our very first beer was Stout \u2014 but there are other fall beer styles and autumn flavors that fit nicely with the season. Maybe the piney aroma of Pale Ale transports you to a cozy campground. Or does lederhosen (and a stein of lager) make it official for you? And if it\u2019s just about some extra oomph, an Imperial beer could be the ticket.\nThere\u2019s always a lot to choose from, so we\u2019ve rounded up our best fall beers to help you narrow it down. Cheers! Or better yet, Prost, given the first one on the list.\n\nOktoberfest Lager\nNorthern Hemisphere Wet Hop IPA\nBarrel-Aged Narwhal Imperial Stout\nTorpedo Extra IPA\nSierra Nevada Stout\nBig Little Thing Hazy Imperial IPA\n\nOktoberfest\nRaise a stein of this German fall favorite.\nOur Oktoberfest beer is available nationwide July\u2013September\nWhat is a Festbier?\nYou\u2019ll usually see Oktoberfest beers that are either M\u00e4rzens or Festbiers. Very simply, a M\u00e4rzen tends to feature a malty richness alongside a dry finish that draws you back. Festbier tones down the malt dominance, allows some hop expression, and drinks \u201clighter\u201d all around. (M\u00e4rzen was the longtime staple of the Munich festival until Festbier started filling steins in the \u201990s.)\nThis year we teamed up on a Festbier with St\u00f6rtebeker, whose home by the Baltic Sea boasts 800 years of brewing history. Our collaboration leads with smooth and biscuity malt character, while organic hops\u2014directly from St\u00f6rtebeker\u2019s hop farmer!\u2014impart layers of citrusy and herbal flavor. Lager yeast rounds it out, shaping the crisp, clean finish that brings you back for more.\u200b\nAnd if you\u2019re hungry, pour a half cup of Oktoberfest toward our Pretzel Skillet with Beer Cheese.\nFind Oktoberfest\nNorthern Hemisphere Wet Hop IPA\nHops from field to kettle within 24 hours.\nAvailable exclusively online starting in late September. Shipping to select states, while supplies last.\nFall is extra special to craft brewers for one delicious reason: the annual hop harvest. That\u2019s when we travel to the Pacific Northwest for \u201chop selection,\u201d which includes rubbing hops \u2014 literally smashing the cones in our palms to tease out the aromatic properties.\nAnd some hops are so magical, we just can\u2019t wait; we skip the drying and packaging steps entirely.\nNorthern Hemisphere IPA, at 6.7% ABV, exclusively features Centennial hops that we pick and rush to our brew kettles the very same day. This earns it the \u201cwet hop IPA\u201d designation, and its vibrant notes of citrus blossom, rose, and pine are like your personal stroll through a hop field.\nBuy Northern Hemisphere Available late September 2025\nBarrel-Aged Narwhal Imperial Stout\nFrom the depths, our barrel-aged autumn imperial stout.\nAvailable online for direct shipping to select states\nBarrel-Aged Narwhal has, at least in theory, been in stores for a few years. But we hear it often from fans: I can\u2019t find it. And this beer is too good to live in obscurity. So now it\u2019s loaded in our online shop, and we\u2019re direct shipping to approved states.\nOur original Narwhal spends nearly a year in bourbon-barrel hibernation, emerging transformed with notes of oak, vanilla, and coconut layered onto the Stout\u2019s malt flavors of dark chocolate and espresso. Pour it into a snifter glass and settle in for a slow-sipping delight.\nBuy Barrel-Aged Narwhal\nTorpedo Extra IPA\nA direct hit of hops, every time.\nAvailable year-round\nTurn on the game, make some wings, and taste explosive hops with Torpedo\u2019s intense notes of citrus, tropical fruit and pine, all cranked to max flavor through the custom Hop Torpedo dry-hopping device. You win, even if your team doesn\u2019t.\nFind Torpedo\nSierra Nevada Stout\nThe launchpad for, well, everything.\nAvailable online for direct shipping to select states\nPale Ale often gets the credit, but it all started with Sierra Nevada Stout, the first beer we ever made on our original hand-built brewhouse. (What better way to stress test your handiwork than with a bold and dark Stout?) It\u2019s packed with deep, roasted malt flavors, plus a nod to the West Coast with a heap of American hops.\nBuy Sierra Nevada Stout\nBig Little Thing Hazy Imperial IPA\nDialed up to 9.5%, yet drinks like a dream.\nAvailable year-round\nWhen the wind reaches your bones, sometimes it\u2019s as simple as, \u201cGive me anything big.\u201d But make it count: Big Little Thing balances hop intensity and smooth drinkability. Mosaic, El Dorado and Comet hops are in the mix, but there\u2019s a ringleader.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Citra hops making it all sing,\u201d says Isaiah Mangold, our Manager of Innovation. \u201cOrange is prominent, but there are other citrus notes\u2026maybe some yuzu in there, and also a nice underlying sweetness of berry.\u201d After all, those sun-drenched flavors could be the warmth you need this fall.\nFind Big Little Thing\nFall Beer Styles\nNot ready for the list above? Then let\u2019s zoom out and explore beer styles for fall that embody the comfort of autumn. From deep, dark flavors that wrap you like a blanket to easy-drinkers for holiday hangouts, these are some go-to styles for the cool months ahead.\nFresh Hop IPA\nHop harvest happens once a year, right as fall approaches, and hop flavor is most intense right when they\u2019re picked. Fresh Hop IPAs like Celebration IPA capture the full power of citrus, pine, and floral notes from just-picked hops. Some brewers use the phrases \u201cfresh hop\u201d and \u201cwet hop\u201d interchangeably, but we break \u2018em out. Wet hops, like we use toward Northern Hemisphere IPA, are picked, not dried, and race to the brew kettle within 1\u20132 days. Fresh hops meanwhile go through the standard process \u2014 they\u2019re kiln dried and packed into 200-pound bales \u2014 but they\u2019re also rushed into brewing, within a few weeks. Either way, you\u2019re getting peak hop flavor with a Fresh Hop IPA or a Wet Hop IPA.\nStout\nThe American stout is as dark as it gets, the abundance of roasted malts lending that midnight color, while also boosting the body and evoking flavors of chocolate and coffee. But here come the hops, in true American craft beer fashion, to dial up the bitterness units and weave in citrusy or earthy notes, depending on the hop varieties. Sierra Nevada Stout was the first beer we ever made, and now the malty monster Narwhal Imperial Stout is a favorite in our lineup. Get the fireplace rolling this fall, sit down with a stout, and breathe a happy sigh.\nAmber Ale\nAmber ales are \u201cless hoppy and perhaps slightly darker than Pale Ales,\u201d says brewing scientist Charlie Bamforth. Indeed, with their artful balance of malt and hops, amber ales are a crowdpleaser \u2014 have been since the \u201980s. Crystal and caramel malts, kilned at high temperatures, provide the style\u2019s namesake amber color, hints of toffee, and extra body. Citrusy and piney hops ensure amber ales don\u2019t veer too sweet and stay in harmony. Watching the game with friends? Can\u2019t go wrong with an amber ale.\nOktoberfest Beers\nBeer\u2019s biggest party comes around every fall, and the official Oktoberfest in Munich features the Festbier style, which is a bright golden lager with malty flavors \u2014 but not heavy because drinkability is key with those jumbo 1-liter steins. The other Oktoberfest style is M\u00e4rzen, which is darker and richer than Festbier, leaning into a bready and toasty malt flavor.\nEach fall we like to brew a German-American collaboration Oktoberfest, and this year\u2019s release with St\u00f6rtebeker is a Festbier that will turn your backyard into a beer garden.\nFall Beer Flavors\nSome of the best autumn beers balance malt richness with seasonal spices.\nPumpkin Beer\nIt\u2019s not just a coffee infatuation; the pumpkin flavors hit beer shelves come fall too. Pumpkin beers tend to be malt-forward and feature the same spices that define holiday baked goods \u2014 think nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, clove. And the pumpkin? Sometimes the real deal, sometimes pumpkin pie spice. Your next pumpkin beer will likely be complex, full of flavor, and possibly a candidate for dessert. We don\u2019t currently have a pumpkin beer, but watch our online shop for rare drops like Spiced Barrel-Aged Bigfoot, a winter sipper infused with orange peel and mulling spices.\nSmoked Beer\nSmoked beers owe their distinct character to (surprise!) smoked malts, which are dried either directly or indirectly over an open flame that\u2019s burning a hardwood such as beechwood. The smoke dances through the grain bed and imparts flavors that conjure scenes of campfires and BBQs. It can be subtle, like in our Narwhal Imperial Stout, or the smoky flavor can headline beers like the German-style rauchbier. Ale or lager, light or dark, most any style can be smoked if a craft brewer imagines it that way.\nFind Beers Nearby\nFall Beer FAQ\u2019s\nWhat is a fall beer?\nFall beers are brews that pair perfectly with cooler weather, changing leaves, and cozy evenings. They often feature richer malts, warming spices, and seasonal ingredients like pumpkin or maple. Think Oktoberfest, amber ales, stouts, and even some hop-forward IPAs that bring a little extra depth.\nIs an IPA a good fall beer?\nAbsolutely! While stouts are traditionally known as great fall beers, IPAs can be just as satisfying when the temperature drops. Many fall IPAs dial up the malt character or use hops that evoke pine, citrus, or spice\u2014making them a bold, refreshing choice for autumn sipping.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between stout and IPA?\nEach offers a different experience for chilly evenings. Stouts are dark, roasty, and often creamy, with flavors like coffee, chocolate, and toasted malt. IPAs are hop-forward, with bright bitterness and aromas ranging from citrus to pine. Both can be excellent fall companions\u2014it just depends on your mood and taste.\nAre there Oktoberfest IPAs?\nWhile traditional Oktoberfest beers are usually M\u00e4rzens (malty lagers), some brewers always enjoy getting creative and sometimes craft IPAs with Oktoberfest-inspired malt profiles. These hybrids blend the hop punch of an IPA with the smooth, toasty backbone of a M\u00e4rzen\u2014perfect for fall festivals\u2026 with a twist!\nWhere can I find fall beers near me?\nYour best bet is to check local breweries, bottle shops, or grocery stores with a seasonal beer section. Many breweries release limited-edition fall beers, so keep an eye out for fresh drops. You can also visit Sierra Nevada\u2019s Beer Finder to locate their seasonal offerings near you.\nShare this article\nUp NextThe Confluence of Passions \u2013 International Explorer, Rafael Pease\nFresh From THE BREWERS CUT\nMore\nOur Beer22 Sep\nYour Harvest Guide: Wet Hops and Fresh Hops\nOur Beer12 Sep\nHow is Non Alcoholic Beer Made\nOur Beer12 Sep\nA guide to Non-Alcoholic Beer\nOur Beer03 Sep\nThe Journey Behind Non-Alc Trail Pass\nOur Beer22 Sep\nYour Harvest Guide: Wet Hops and Fresh Hops\nOur Beer12 Sep\nHow is Non Alcoholic Beer Made\nOur Beer12 Sep\nA guide to Non-Alcoholic Beer\nOur Beer03 Sep\nThe Journey Behind Non-Alc Trail Pass\nMore Stories"

Just supposition and cynicism here, but here's my take:\n\nI've seen similar results at the GABF... breweries entering beers in style categories that really make no sense. What I was told, is that this is often done to increase the likelihood of medaling... picking some obscure style that has fewer entries. I'm guessing the IPA and APA categories have more entries than any other style categories in the competition. Consequently, its very difficult to medal in either category, no matter how good your beer is. On the other hand, the ESB and British ale categories likely have comparatively fewer entries. So assuming Union Jack and SNPA meet the basic style requirements of those categories, I can see where the brewers might have wanted to enter their beers in those two categories. I'm not sure why this sort of thing is allowed, but apparently it's not all that uncommon a practice. #9John_M,May 2, 2025 MutuelsMark, Shanex, keilerdunkel and 5 others like this.   \n10.    \n\nLAFreewayZealot (559) Aug 2, 2023 California  > bcm119 said: \u2191\n\nSo, Firestone Union Jack won the \"British Ale\" category, and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale win the \"ESB\" category?

What am I missing here? Click to expand... I also noticed the ESB problematic winner SNPA. Its an American Pale Ale to my taste. I'd say Montauk Driftwood, one of my standbys, would be a better fit but by no means a prize winner. How about another misplaced beer, the Munich Helles Category second place: Deschutes/Kirkland/Costco Pilsner? It lacks the malty body to me. It tastes like a very good American Lager (adjuncts or not). #11moodenba,May 2, 2025 Last edited: May 2, 2025  MutuelsMark, ChicagoJ, mactrail and 1 other person like this.   \n12.    \n\nAlcahueteJGrand Pooh-Bah (3,170) Dec 4, 2004 Massachusetts Society Pooh-Bah  > John_M said: \u2191\n\nJust supposition and cynicism here, but here's my take:\nI've seen similar results at the GABF... breweries entering beers in style categories that really make no sense.

Category 110, American-Style India Pale Ale, 208 entries\nThe most heavily entered categories.\nThe APA was not in the top 5 of categories.\nJohn_M said: \u2191 \n\nSo assuming Union Jack and SNPA meet the basic style requirements of those categories Click to expand... My comment here is that based upon the hop varieties (i.e., American aroma hops) neither of these beers taste within the styles entered (i.e., ESB, British Ale) for my palate.\n\nFor completeness I was not sitting at the judging table drinking these beers blind but if I was one of the judges who 'voted' to give these beers medals I would be disappointed in myself. I would say to myself: \"how the heck could I not pick up the Cascade hop aroma/flavor in the SNPA\" for example and perceive this beer as an ESB.\nOn a somewhat related note in a couple/few weeks I will be homebrewing my annual batch of ESB and that beer will solely be hoped with East Kent Goldings hops for flavor/aroma.\nCheers!\nP.S. Here is how Sierra Nevada describes SNPA on their website: \"American-style Pale Ale is most celebrated for its hop character, which can range from floral and fruity to fresh pine needles or the sappy resin of a tree.\" #14JackHorzempa,May 2, 2025 MutuelsMark, ChicagoJ, John_M and 1 other person like this.   \n15.    \n\nDomingoGrand Pooh-Bah (4,240) Apr 23, 2005 Colorado Pooh-Bah  > hopfenunmaltz said: \u2191\n\nI've been here often.

Absolutely. There are some discussions on this in the SW forums, but I'd put NM's best against any state in the country. Maybe even per capita based upon how sparsely populated it is. They don't have the sheer #'s of some cities/states, but the stuff in ABQ and SF = the highest of high tier. #15Domingo,May 2, 2025 ChicagoJ and hopfenunmaltz like this.     \n\n \n\ngrantctySavant (1,004) Feb 17, 2008 Minnesota Trader  > moodenba said: \u2191\n\nHow about another misplaced beer, the Munich Helles Category second place: Deschutes/Kirkland/Costco Pilsner?
